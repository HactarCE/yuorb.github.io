**5.0   VERBAL  MORPHOLOGY**

Formatives functioning as verbs in a sentence, rather than nouns, may display several additional morphological categories not found in nouns, including Valence, Mood, Phase, Level, Effect, and Aspect, each of which is discussed in Sections 5.1 through 5.6 below.  All of these categories are shown via the `VnCn` affix in Slot VIII of a formative.  The `VnCn` affix itself is comprised of two different patterns of a vocalic form `Vn` followed by a consonant form  **`Cn`** .  The first of these patterns uses the first four vowel-form series of the Standard Vowel Sequence to respectively indicate Valence, Phase, Level and Effect while the consonant indicates either Mood or Case-Scope (depending on the **V ~C~ /V~K~** syllabic stress distinction from Slot X).   The second pattern uses the same four vowel-form series to show Aspect, differentiated from the first pattern by the **`Cn`** consonant.  The structure and patterns of the Slot VIII `VnCn` affix are shown in the various tables below

Column 1 denotes aspects which place an event/state at some point or duration along a past-to-future linear timeline.  Column 2 denotes aspects which describe the “shape” or structure of a durational event.  Column 3 denotes aspects which associate an effect or “consequence” to the temporal aspect of a state/event on a past-to-future linear timeline.  Colum 4 denotes six aspects which associate non-temporal adverbial notions to the start or end of a state/event, plus three miscellaneous aspects.

**5.1   [Valence]()**

**The term ****Valence** as used in this grammar refers to the manner of participation of two separate entities or parties to any given verb, i.e., participation by one party automatically implies participation by another party to the same act, event, or state in either a parallel, corollary, or complementary fashion. Such dual participation occurs naturally in the verbs of world languages and is the province of what is known as “co-active” verbs. While all languages implicitly have co-active verbs, Ithkuil explicitly shows this dual participation in a formal and systematic way. To illustrate the concept of co-activity in English compare the following pairs of sentences:

| 1a)*I found an old man.*          | **→** | 1b)*I found an empty can.*             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2a)*I threw the ball at Sam.*     | **→** | 2b)*I threw the ball at the window.*   |
| 3a)*I performed in front of her.* | **→** | 3b)*I performed in front of the wall.* |

Note that the first member of each sentence pair has an animate object of the verb (*an old man, Sam, *and * her* ), while the second member of each pair has an inanimate object (*an empty can, the window, *and * the wall* ). Now compare this set of sentence pairs to the similar set below:

| 1c)*I met an old man.*     | **→** | 1d)  ** I met an empty can.*          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 2c)*I threw Sam the ball.* | **→** | 2d)  ** I threw the window the ball.* |
| 3c)*I entertained her.*    | **→** | 3d)  ** I entertained the wall.*      |

The asterisk * indicates that the second sentence of these pairs is semantically unacceptable to English speakers. Why? The second set of sentence pairs parallel the first set except that the verbs  *find* ,  *throw at* , and *perform* have been replaced by the semantically similar  *meet* ,  *throw* , and  *entertain* . Nevertheless, the use of inanimate objects with these latter three verbs appears unacceptable. The reason is that the verbs in the first set are “mono-active,” i.e., they do not require that the object participate in the action in any way, whereas the verbs in the second set are “co-active,” requiring that the object participate in the action along with the subject. Thus, while I can *find* an old man without the old man doing anything about it or even being aware of it, I cannot *meet* an old man without the old man also meeting me. I can *throw a ball at Sam* without Sam noticing, but if I *throw Sam a ball* it implies that he is expected to participate by catching it.

Similarly, I can *perform* in front of someone even if they’re asleep, but I can’t *entertain* them unless they are participating in the situation by observing me. The participatory relationship involving the second party of a co-active verb differs depending on the context. It can be a parallel relationship (i.e., both parties participate identically) as implied by the English adverb ‘together’ in  *He and I jog together* , or a reciprocal relationship as in the sentence *I met the old man* (i.e., and so he met me) or in verbs used with the adverbial phrase ‘each other,’ as in  *We love each other* . The relationship can be one of accompaniment as in *I played along with him* (e.g., as he sang), or a complementary relationship as in *I threw Sam the ball* (i.e., and so he caught it).

Other sorts of co-active relationships are possible. It is the differences in these relationships that are systematized in Ithkuil into the category called Valence. In English and other languages co-activity is rarely explicit and systematic (the use of adverbs such as ‘together,’ ‘each other,’ or prefixes such as ‘out-’ as in *out-perform* are some exceptions), and when lexified within a verb itself, are implicitly specific to that verb, giving rise to monoactive/co-active pairs such as  *find/meet, throw at/throw, perform/entertain* , etc. In Ithkuil, co-activity is explicitly shown morphologically, and the types of co-active relationships, i.e., the valences of the verb, are systematic and fully productive for all verbs. As a result, no mono-active versus co-active lexical distinctions are necessary, i.e., all verbs can function monoactively as well as co-actively.

There are nine valences in New Ithkuil: the MONOACTIVE, PARALLEL, COROLLARY, RECIPROCAL, COMPLEMENTARY, DUPLICATIVE, DEMONSTRATIVE,  CONTINGENT, and PARTICIPATIVE. Valence is shown by the vocalic **V****~N~** affix in formative Slot VIII.  Note that the presence of a **V****~N~** affix in Slot VIII requires that it be immediately followed by a consonantal **C****~N~** affix denoting either the category of Mood (see [**Sec. 5.2**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_05_verbs.htm#Sec5_2) below) or Case-Scope (see [**Sec. 4.10**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_04_case.htm#Sec4_10)).  The nine valences are explained below.

| **5.1.1** | **MNO** |  | **The Monoactive** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------ |

The MONOACTIVE valence is the default valence and indicates a lack of co-activity, i.e., no participation by a second party is implied.

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **MNO** -OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’*

[the implication being that the two children are not playing with each other nor are they necessarily playing the same game]

| [**5.1.2**]() | **PRL** |  | **The Parallel** |
| ---------------- | ------------- | - | ---------------------- |

The PARALLEL valence indicates that a second party is engaging in the same activity as the first party at same time. It would be used in translating sentences such as  *The children all sang together, We both went jogging on the parkway* .

**Švelähá**  **elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **PRL** -FAC-OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’* [they are playing the same kind of game but separately from each other]

| **5.1.3** | **CRO** |  | **The Corollary** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ----------------------- |

The COROLLARY valence is similar to the PARALLEL, except that the second party engages in related activity at the same time as the first party, rather than the same activity. It would be used in translating sentences such as  *The children played in the yard * (i.e., each child engaged in a different play activity) or *The band played my favorite song* (implying that not everyone in the band was playing the same instrument, or perhaps that someone in the band sang as opposed to playing an instrument).

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’* [they are playing at the same time, but each is playing a different game]

| **5.1.4** | **RCP** |  | **The Reciprocal** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------ |

The RECIPROCAL valence indicates identical activity by one party directed at another party and vice-versa, thus translating the English adverbial phrases ‘each other’ and ‘one another,’ as in  *The clown and the grocer despise one another* .  NOTE, however, that in sentences where two parties in a reciprocal relationship are named by one referent, the verb often requires use of the SBS suffix on the referent to indicate that separate parties within the named referent are participating in the reciprocal relationship, otherwise, the party named will be assumed as a whole to constitute one “side” of the reciprocal activity (as in the example immediately below).

The following examples illustrate the usage of RCP valence and the SBS suffix:

**Šveladřihá  elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]-**SBS**₁/1- **RCP** -FAC-OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’* [they are playing with each other]

If it is necessary to specify a specific case-relationship for one or both parties in the reciprocal relationship, it will be necessary to name the parties separately so that appropriate cases can be assigned.  For example:

**Wioňihá  puyuöt.**

[default `Ca` ]-N-‘write’- **RCP** -FAC-OBS       ma/BEN-IND+TSP-2m/BEN

‘ *You (two) write on each other’s behalf* .’  (LITERALLY:  ‘ *(S)he writes on behalf of you and vice-versa* .’)

**Malihá  lalecu  welü  kši’la.**

‘talk’-[default `Ca` ]- **RCP** -FAC-OBS     ‘person’-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/3-IND    [default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘child-DAT    ‘clown’-[default `Ca` ]-PRN

‘*The*  *man and the child talk to each other about the clown* .’  OR  ‘ *The man and the child discuss the clown* .’

**Malihá  ňu  kši’la.**

‘talk’-[default `Ca` ]- **RCP** -FAC-OBS    pa/NEU-IND    ‘clown’-[default `Ca` ]-PRN

‘*They*  *talk about the clown (with somebody else)* .’  OR  ‘ *They discuss the clown( with somebody)* .’

**Malihá  ňuxadřa  kši’la.**

‘talk’-[default `Ca` ]- **RCP** -FAC-OBS     pa/NEU-IND-**SBS**₁/1    ‘clown’-[default `Ca` ]-PRN

‘*They*  *talk to each other about the clown* .’  OR  ‘ *They discuss the clown* .’

If necessary to specify that the reciprocity is of a “back (and forth)” nature, where first one party initiates an action which is subsequently paralleled back to the first party, one should utilize **ITC** aspect (see [**Sec. 5.6.34**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_05_verbs.htm#Sec5_6_34)).  Furthermore, one can use the ITN affix and/or Phase to provide additional detail if necessary.  Additionally, the SWR affix can be utilized to specify that a referenced formative is the same as one of the reciprocal parties, e.g.,

**Malihá  lalecu  welü  lalecë’iča.**

‘talk’-[default `Ca` ]- **RCP** -FAC-OBS   ‘person’-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/3-IND    [default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘child-DAT     ‘person’-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/3- **SWR₁/5** -PRN

‘*The*  *man and the child talk to each other about the man.’  * [i.e., the man being talked about is the same man who is talking with the child].

| [**5.1.5**]() | **CPL** |  | **The Complementary** |
| ---------------- | ------------- | - | --------------------------- |

The COMPLEMENTARY valence indicates that the second party performs a complementary activity to that of the first party. By “complementary” is meant an activity different from that of the first party, but necessary to complete the whole of the joint activity, i.e., the “other half” of the joint activity. This is exemplified in sentences such as  *The man and his son played catch, Hortense took me into the woods, The clown read the children a story, My back itches so I scratch it* , where ‘played catch’ implies the complementary activities of throwing and catching, ‘took (into the woods)’ implies someone leading while the other follows, ‘read’ implies a reader and an audience, and ‘itches’ implies scratching.

**Švelëihá  elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **CPL** -FAC-OBS      STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’* [they are playing a coplementary game/activity with each other, where one performs one half/side of the activity and the other performs the other half]

| **5.1.6** | **DUP** |  | **The Duplicative** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------- |

The DUPLICATIVE valence indicates that the second party copies or repeats the activity of the first party, as in the sentences *Let’s draw a picture* (i.e., I’ll draw it first, then you draw the same picture), *They both read that book* (i.e., first one, then the other), *I bought a new car* (i.e., and now someone else is buying a new car, too).

**Švelöhá  wesu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **DUP** -FAC-OBS    [default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor.’* [where one child performs a play activity and the second child then copies/duplicates the same activity]

| **5.1.7** | **DEM** |  | **The Demonstrative** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | --------------------------- |

The DEMONSTRATIVE valence indicates that the first party demonstrates for the second party how to do something or what to do. Thus an Ithkuil sentence constructed as *We played chess* with the verb in the DEMONSTRATIVE valence would mean ‘I showed her how to play chess,’ while the sentence constructed as *They fought us* in this valence would mean ‘They taught us how to fight.’

**Švelohá  elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **DEM** -FAC-OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are on the floor and one is showing the other how to play (a game).’*

| **5.1.8** | **CNG** |  | **The Contingent** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------ |

The CONTINGENT valence indicates that the second party engages in the next or dependent phase of a multi-part activity, the specific activity being dependent on context. Thus the Ithkuil sentence *I started the campfire for my friend* in the CONTINGENT implies that the friend then performed the next logical step, i.e., he cooked the food.

**Švelühá  elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **CNG** -FAC-OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are playing on the floor and one performs one part of the play activity, then the other performs the next part.’*

| **5.1.9** | **PTI** |  | **The Participative** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | --------------------------- |

The PARTICIPATIVE valence indicates that the parties take part in an activity involving a greater whole, translatable by the English phrase ‘take part in.…’ Thus, the Ithkuil sentence *They raced *in the PARTICIPATIVE means ‘They each took part in the race.’

**Šveluhá  elasu  ukthili’a.**

‘play’-CSV-[default `Ca` ]- **PTI** -FAC-OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-DPX-IND      STEM3/PRC-‘floor’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-LOC

*‘Two children are on the floor taking part in the play activity.’*

[**5.2   Mood**]()

Most languages have a morphological category for verbs known as “mood,” serving to indicate specific attitudes or perspectives on the act, condition, or event, or the degree of factuality involved. Example moods common to Western languages include the indicative (factual utterances), subjunctive (showing doubt or probability, expressed by ‘may/might’ in English), imperative (indicating commands, e.g., *Go now!, Sing it for us!* ), conditional (expressing hypotheticals, e.g.,  *She would travel if she could* ), optative (indicating wishes, hopes, expectations, e.g.,  *I wish he’d go, I expect him to be here* ), and hortative (indicating exhortations, e.g.,  *May he live 100 years! Let them see for themselves!* ).

In New Ithkuil, moods simply convey a two-fold distinction as to whether the factuality of an utterance is certain or uncertain, combined with a three-way distinction as to whether the factuality of an explicit or implicit assumption underlying the utterance (i.e., a presupposition) is true, false, or unknown. This twofold by threefold matrix renders a total of six moods:  the  **FACTUAL** ,  **SUBJUNCTIVE** ,  **ASSUMPTIVE** ,  **SPECULATIVE** ,  **COUNTERFACTIVE** , and **HYPOTHETICAL,** explained below.

Mood is shown via the **`Cn`** affix in Slot VIII, immediately following the `Vn` affix. Note that this is the same affix that shows Case-Scope in nominal formatives (i.e., nouns), as already described in Sec. 4.10.  The determination as to whether a formative is a noun or verb can be made by its syllabic stress pattern.  For our purposes here, verbal formatives where the **`Cn`** affix in Slot VIII shows Mood will always be stressed on the final syllable of the word.  This is explained in detail in [**Sec. 6.2.1**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_06_more_verbs.htm#Sec6_2_1) on Relation.

| **5.2.1** | **FAC** |  | **The Factual** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | --------------------- |

The FACTUAL mood is the default mood and is unmarked if Slot VIII is otherwise unfilled/unmarked.  Otherwise, it is marked by the **`Cn`** affix - **h** - in Slot VIII.   The FACTUAL mood signifies that the factuality of the speaker’s statement is certain and that there either is no underlying presupposition to the statement, or if there is, its factuality is also certain or has no bearing on the factuality of the statement. Examples:

**Yuçká  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **FAC** -OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘Their kids are ill’.* [i.e., it is known he has kids and it is known they are ill]

**Hlešvie-galoktähá  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**FAC**-OBS   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

 *‘She and I are (planning on) taking a walk later on’. * [i.e., it is our intention and we have the opportunity to do so]

**Webglá  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **FAC** -OBS   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘His wife’s clothes are inside-out.’*

| **5.2.2** | **SUB** |  | **The Subjunctive** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------- |

The SUBJUNCTIVE mood is marked by the **`Cn`** affix - **hl** - in Slot VIII.  It indicates that the factuality of an explicit or implicit presupposition underlying the statement is certain, but the factuality of the speaker’s statement itself is questionable or uncertain, the specific nuance of factuality intended being subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Corresponds roughly with English ‘may,’ ‘maybe’ or ‘might,’ with the added distinction that an explicit or implicit (i.e., underlying) presupposition is true. Examples:

**Yuçkahlá  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **SUB** -OBS    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘Maybe his kids are ill.’* [i.e., it is known that he has kids but it is not known whether they are ill]

**Hlešvie-galoktählá  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**SUB**-OBS   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

 *‘She and I may take a walk later on.’ * [i.e., it is known that the opportunity to do so will arise, but it is uncertain whether we will choose to]

**Webglahlá  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **SUB** -OBS   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘His wife’s clothes may be inside-out.’*

| **5.2.3** | **ASM** |  | **The Assumptive** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------ |

The ASSUMPTIVE mood is marked by the **`Cn`** affix - **hr** - in Slot VIII.  It functions identically to the FACTUAL except that the factuality of an underlying presupposition is unknown. It therefore conveys an act, state, or event whose factuality is dependent on whether something else is factual, thus corresponding to certain usages of English ‘maybe’ and ‘will’ (where ‘will’ primarily conveys possibility, not future tense). As with all moods, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Examples:

**Yuçkahrú  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **ASM** -INF    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘His kids’ll be ill* **OR** *If he has kids, they are ill.’* [i.e., it is unknown whether he has kids, but if he does, they are certainly ill.]

**Hlešvie-galoktährá  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**ASM**-OBS   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

*‘She and I will take a walk later on’* [i.e., if we can] **OR** ‘*We intend to take a walk’.* [i.e., but we don’t know if we’ll be able to]

**Webglahrû  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **ASM** -ITU   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘If he has a wife her clothes are inside-out.’*

**NOTE:**  In the examples immediately above, an astute reader will notice that in addition to the shift in Mood to ASSUMPTIVE, the Validation of the verb (see [**Sec. 6.1.2**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_06_more_verbs.htm#Sec6_1_2)) may have to change as well — since the factuality of the underlying assumption is now suspect, the basis for the speaker’s knowledge of the event is not their own empirical observation, but rather becomes based on intuition, inference, etc., which must be reflected by the Validation category.  This is true for the remaining three Moods as well.

| **5.2.4** | **SPC** |  | **The Speculative** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------- |

The SPECULATIVE mood is marked by the **`Cn`** affix - **hm** - in Slot VIII.  It indicates that the factuality of both the presupposition and the statement itself are unknown. Its translation into English is dependent on the specific context, sometimes corresponding to ‘may,’ ‘maybe’ or ‘might,’ and at other times corresponding to the auxiliary ‘would.’ Compare the examples below to those above:

**Yuçkahmû  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **SPC** -ITU    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘Maybe his kids are ill.’ * [i.e., it is unknown if he has kids but if he does, they may be ill]

**Hlešvie-galoktähmû  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**SPC**-ITU   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

*‘She and I may take a walk later on.’ * [i.e., it is unknown whether we will have the opportunity to do so, and even if we do, it is uncertain whether we will choose to]

**Webglahmû  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **SPC** -ITU   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘If he has a wife her clothes may be inside-out.’*

| **5.2.5** | **COU** |  | **The Counterfactive** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ---------------------------- |

The COUNTERFACTIVE mood is marked by the **`Cn`** affix - **hn** - in Slot VIII.  It indicates that the factuality of the underlying presupposition is false or unreal but that the factuality of the statement would otherwise be true. It thus corresponds to the English construction of auxiliary ‘would’ or ‘would have’ in its use to show counterfactuality (i.e., what would have been if a false presupposition had been true). Again, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Compare the examples below to those above.

**Yuçkahnú  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **COU** -INF    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘His kids would be (would have been) ill.’ * [i.e., if he had kids they would be ill, but he doesn’t]

**Hlešvie-galoktähnû  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**COU**-ITU   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

*‘She and I would take (would have taken) a walk later on.’ * [i.e., it is our intention but we won’t have the opportunity]

**Webglahnú  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **COU** -INF   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘If he were to have a wife her clothes would be inside-out.’*

| **5.2.6** | **HYP** |  | **The Hypothetical** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | -------------------------- |

The HYPOTHETICAL mood is marked by the **`Cn`** affix -**h** **ň** - in Slot VIII.  It indicates that the factuality of the underlying presupposition is false or unreal and that the factuality of the statement itself would nevertheless be uncertain even if the underlying presupposition were true.  It thus corresponds to the English construction of auxiliary ‘might have’ in its use to show possible counterfactuality (i.e., what might have been if a false presupposition had been true). Again, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Compare the examples below to those above.

**Yuçkahňú  elari.**

 *PRX-STEM3/PRC* *-‘suffer.from.illness’- **HYP** -INF    STEM2/PRC-‘child’-G-AFF*

*‘His kids might’ve been ill.’* [i.e., if he had kids, but he doesn’t, so we’ll never know]

**Hlešvie-galoktähňû  pra’i.**

 *CONCATENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC-‘self-involved.leisure.activity’-PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’-[default `Ca` ]-TPP₁/7-PRL-**HYP**-ITU   ma/BEN+1m/BEN-ACT*

*‘She and I might’ve taken a walk later on.’* [i.e., but we won’t have the opportunity, so the decision whether to do so is moot].

**Webglahňú  afbalfa  umflilacai  pei.**

 *[* *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-‘be.inside-out’- **HYP** -INF   PRC-‘article.of.clothing’-ASO/MDC-THM   STEM3/PRC-‘spouse’-OBJ-[default `Ca` ]-GID₁/1-POS    ma/BEN-GEN*

*‘If he were to have a wife her clothes might be inside-out.’* [i.e., but he doesn’t have a wife, so whether her clothes would or wouldn’t be wet is moot]

**NOTE:**  In the above examples for both the COUNTERFACTIVE and the HYPOTHETICAL moods, the Validation on the verbs could also be either UNSPECIFIED or IMAGINARY (see [**Sec. 6.1.2**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_06_more_verbs.htm#Sec6_1_2)) depending on the whether the speaker wishes to emphasize the unreal nature of the statement or not.

**5.2.7   The Mood + Case-Scoping Affix**

As an alternative to using **`Cn`** in Slot VIII, the **MCS** affix is available to mark the five non-FAC moods or the five non-CCN Case-Scoping values.  (See [**Chapter 7 on Affixes**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_07_affixes.htm) for details on the use of Slot V and Slot VII affixes and how to structure them.)

| -**bẓ** | **MCS  Mood and Case-Scoping **  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1              | SUB  SUBJUNCTIVE Mood            |
| 2              | ASM  ASSUMPTIVE Mood             |
| 3              | SPC  SPECULATIVE Mood            |
| 4              | COU  COUNTERFACTIVE Mood         |
| 5              | HYP  HYPOTHETICAL Mood           |
| 6              | ##### CCA  ANTECEDENT case-scope |

| 9              | ##### CCP  PRECEDENT case-scope  |
| 0              | ##### CCV  SUCCESSIVE case-scope |

**5.3  Phase**

Phase refers to variances in the temporal pattern of how an act, condition or event occurs, e.g., in a momentary, lasting, or repetitive manner (or lack thereof). This is especially useful in describing phenomena that occur in sudden bursts of short duration, e.g., flashing, sputtering, blinking, alternating, etc. Phase functions closely with the morphological category of Extension, previously described in Sec. 3.4, to specify the durational nature, starting and ending, and operative pattern of a state, action or event.  Phase is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII.  The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence above, i.e., showing Valence and Phase via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Valence, it cannot show Phase, and vice-versa.  (Note that it is possible to show either Valence or Phase on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.)  The nine Phases are  **PUNCTUAL** ,  **ITERATIVE** ,  **REPETITIVE** ,  **INTERMITTENT** ,  **RECURRENT** ,  **FREQUENTATIVE** ,  **FRAGMENTATIVE** ,  **VACILLITATIVE** , and **FLUCTUATIVE**, described below.

| **5.3.1** | **PUN** |  | **The Punctual** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ---------------------- |

The **PUNCTUAL** Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value - **ai** - in Slot VIII.  It describes an act, condition, or event which is point-like, momentary or instantaneous in nature, such as an explosion, a flash of lightning, a blow, a single handclap, a collision between two objects, a stab of pain, a single cough, the clicking of a lock, etc.   It can be visually represented along a timeline by a single point, e.g.,  **•**

**Weždaihá  sstilomke.**

 *[*  *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-* ‘sound.of.high-pitched.buzz/beep’- **PCT** -OBS    ‘device’-OBJ- *[*  *default `Ca` ]-* FGN₁/7-ABS

*‘The alien device (has) emitted a single short beeping sound.’*

| **5.3.2** | **ITR** |  | **The Iterative** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ----------------------- |

The ITERATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value - **au** - in Slot VIII.  It refers to a momentary or instantaneous event, like the PUNCTUAL above, which repeats itself in a rapid, on/off, staccato manner, like a machine gun burst, strobe light burst, an alarm bell ringing, or the quick unconscious tapping of a finger, the whole considered as a single event.  Visual representation:   **• • • •**

**Weždauhá  sstilomke.**

 *[*  *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-* ‘sound.of.high-pitched.buzz/beep’- **ITR** -OBS    ‘device’-OBJ- *[*  *default `Ca` ]-* FGN₁/7-ABS

*‘The alien device (has) emitted a series of short beeping sounds.’*

| **5.3.3** | **REP** |  | **The Repetitive** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | ------------------------ |

The REPETITIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value - **ei** - in Slot VIII.  It refers to a relatively brief event of indeterminate or vague duration but repeated in an on/off staccato manner, like a car horn being honked repeatedly in a fast steady rhythm, or an automatic machine press.   Visual representation:  **— — — —**

**Weždeihá  sstilomke.**

 *[*  *default `Ca` ]-STEM2/PRC-* ‘sound.of.high-pitched.buzz/beep’- **REP** -OBS    ‘device’-OBJ- *[*  *default `Ca` ]-* FGN₁/7-ABS

*‘The alien device (has) emitted a series of long beeping sounds.’*

| **5.3.4** | **ITM** |  | **The Intermittent** |
| --------------- | ------------- | - | -------------------------- |

The INTERMITTENT Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value - **eu** - in Slot VIII.  It is similar to the ITERATIVE above, identifying a repetitive occurrence of a PUNCTUAL event, however, unlike the ITERATIVE, the duration of time between repetitions is relatively long and contextually relevant. It would be used in describing the downbeat pattern of a pop song, the ongoing snapping of fingers to music, the steady one-drop-at-a-time dripping of a faucet, etc.   Visual representation: ** • — • — • — •**

The FREQUENTATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value - **ou** - in Slot VIII.  It indicates an iterative occurrence (a single set of punctual repetitions) which in turn repeats at intervals, the whole considered as a single event. Examples would be the repetitive sets of hammerings of a woodpecker or the repeated short bursts of a jackhammer.   Visual representation: **—** **• • •— • • •— • • •— • • •**

**5.4  [Effect]()**

The category of Effect indicates whether a formative is beneficial or detrimental to a particular party.  There is also a neutral or “unknown” value for Effect that indicates neither benefit nor detriment.  Effect is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII.  Effect may also be indicated using a - `VxCs` -  affix, an affixual adjunct, or via a Referential.  Absence of Effect is equivalent to Neutral Effect, i.e., no statement about the Effect is being made (e.g., because Effect is shown elsewhere in the sentence on a different formative or via a Referential or modular adjunct).

The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence or Phase above, i.e., showing Valence, Phase or Effect via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are all mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Effect, it cannot show Valence or Phase.  (Note that it is possible to show either Valence or Phase or Effect on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.)  The nine Effects are described below, with examples of their use shown in Sec. 5.4.10.

**5.4.1   1:BEN   Beneficial to Speaker**

**BENEFICIAL TO SPEAKER** Effect is shown by a  `Vn` affix value of - **ia** - (or - **uä** - if immediately preceded by a - **y** -) in Slot VIII.  It indicates that the formative is of benefit to the first-person speaker of the sentence.

[**5.5  Level**]()

**Level** corresponds roughly to what is known as degree of comparison in other languages. Many languages morphologically indicate degrees of comparison as exemplified by the English suffixes -*er* and -*est* seen in  *great-greater-greatest* , or alternately with the adverbs *more* and  *most* , as well as their negative counterparts *less* and  *least* . The New Ithkuil comparison schema is much more complex than those found in natural languages and is designed to eliminate various ambiguities that arise from those simpler schemata, as discussed below.

### 5.5.1 Ambiguity and Under-Specification in Natural Languages

The comparison schemata of natural languages tend to grossly under-specify the exact semantic nature of the comparison. A clear case of such under-specification can be seen in an English example sentence such as *Jane is healthier.* This sentence can mean any of the following:

*1.       **Jane's state of health has improved, although she is still unwell.*

2. *Jane's state of health has improved so that now she is well (whereas before she was unwell).*

*3.       **Jane's state of health is even better than it previously was (i.e., she was healthy before, but is even healthier now).*

*4.       **Jane's state of health is not as poor as someone else's state of health (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).*

*5.       **Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, so that Jane can be considered healthy while the other is unwell.*

6. *Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, even though both can be considered healthy.*

This ambiguity is not alleviated even when we specify a party to which Jane's health is being compared as in  *Jane is healthier than Sue* , which can mean:

*a)      **Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's although both are unwell.*

*b)      **Jane's state of health is better than Sue's, so that Jane can be considered well while Sue is unwell.*

*c)       **Both Jane and Sue are healthy, but Jane's state of health is even better than Sue's.*

*d)      **Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).*

This sort of ambiguity allows odd-sounding sentences such as  *Snow is warmer * (e.g., than liquid nitrogen) to be perfectly grammatical. What is important to note about the above analysis is that the words *healthier* or *warmer* do not indicate in the actual context of usage *whether a person is actually healthy or whether snow is actually warm.* Rather English -*er* and -*est* (and *more* and  *most* ) as well as their negative counterparts (*less* and  *least* ) merely serve to indicate *on a relative scale* a relationship between two entities being compared (or where only one party is mentioned, in relationship to some unspecified standard or expectation). Additional statements are needed to clarify the actual context to determine where the entities fall on the quantitative "spectrum" or range of the particular quality or attribute pair in question, e.g.,  *unhealthy * <—>  *healthy* .

The New Ithkuil comparison scheme inherently specifies such relative comparison while simultaneously specifying placement within the qualitative spectrum, so that ambiguity as to whether “healthier” means the person is well or unwell is eliminated.

### 5.5.2 Relative Versus Absolute Comparison

An additional aspect of New Ithkuil comparison is the concept of **relative comparison **versus ** absolute comparison** . This is an important concept which impacts the truth value of a statement based upon context. Specifically, relative comparison allows for statements to be true within the narrow confines of the context-at-hand, whereas absolute comparison allows for statements to be true without reference to any specific context. This can be illustrated by the following examples.

*a)      ** Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.*

*b)      ** That highway is the fastest way into town.*

Both of these sentences are true in certain pragmatic contexts and not true in others. For example, while Sirius is the most luminous star as seen from Earth, this is merely due to its relative nearness to Earth (8.4 light years) as compared to most other stars. There are thousands of known stars which are larger (and inherently more luminous) than Sirius but are much further away from Earth. So Sentence (a) is true in a relative context but false in an absolute context. Similarly the highway in Sentence (b) may be the fastest way in most conditions, but if there is a traffic jam or an accident blocking the highway, or if one has access to a private helicopter, then the statement would be false. Therefore, it is only true in a narrow context determined by the pragmatics of the moment it is spoken. New Ithkuil allows speakers to specify whether a comparison is to be interpreted within the context-at-hand (relative comparison) or as an absolute statement irrespective of the context-at-hand.

5.5.3  Comparison Operators (Levels)

There are nine comparison operators for the Ithkuil verb, called Levels, which specify the comparative relationship involved, e.g.,  *same as, more than, less than* , etc.  Relative Level is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII.  The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence, Phase, or Effect above, i.e., showing Valence, Phase, Effect or Level via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are all mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Level, it cannot show Valence, Phase or Effect.  (Note that it is possible to show these categories on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.)  The nine Effects are described below, with examples of their use shown in Sec. 5.5.4.

In interpreting the meaning of the various Levels, the terms used in the formulas below refer to the following **X-M-(Y)** model, where M represents a verb or an adjectival description, X is the "subject" of the verb, and Y is the standard being compared to.

| Sue         | dances as well as /``dances better than /``dances worse than``etc. | Mary          | **OR** | Sue         | is as smart``is smarter than``is less smart than``etc. | Mary |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| **X** | **M**                                                                             | **(Y)** | **X**  | **M** | **(Y)**                                                               |      |

Note that the meaning of each Level allows for an interpretation in which there is no Y term so that the standard of comparison is a previous state of X, e.g., the difference between *Sue dances better than Mary* versus  *Sue dances better than before* .

The VN values in Slot VIII above can only show relative Level, not absolute Level.  To show Absolute Level, use a LVL affix in Type-2 (see [**Chapter 7** **on Affixes**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_07_affixes.htm)) in Slot V or VII of the formative.

The exact nature of the comparison can be further specified by the following **XCL** affix, in order to  explicitly reference an external standard or expectation of the quality being compared.  The affix is applied to either the “X” noun bearing a LEVEL Comparison Operator or the “Y” noun to which something is compared (the “than Y”).  The “Y” noun is declined into the COMPARATIVE Case.

| -**çx** | **XCL  External Standard for Comparison for Use with Levels **                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | ...although X (still) isn’t very M compared to some external standard or expectation of M-ness                                                 |
| **2**    | ...and where X now meets some external standard or expectation of M-ness                                                                        |

| **5**    | ...and where both X and Y meet some external standard or expectation of M-ness, where previously only Y met/exceeded it                         |
| **6**    | ...and where both X and Y exceed some external standard or expectation of M-ness, where previously only Y exceeded it                           |
| **7**    | ...and where X’s degree of M-ness exceeds that of Y, but neither is (still) very M compered to some external standard or expectation of M-ness |

Another important affix used with Levels is the **COS** affix to more exactly specify the nature of the comparison:

| -lc         | **COS**   **Comparison Specifications ** (Used with Levels )      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | “more”/“less” = extent/amount/volume                                |
| **2** | “harder”/“weaker” = degree of intensity or effort                   |
| **3** | “longer”/“shorter” = duration; time spent being/doing               |
| **4** | “better”/“worse” = quality / style                                  |
| **5** | “more efficiently”/“less efficiently” =  effort relative to outcome |

**5.6  Aspect**

Aspect provides detailed and specific temporal information about the verb, not in relation to the speaker’s present moment of utterance (as with Perspective in Sec. 3.3), but rather in relation to the contextual “present” of the act, condition, or event being spoken about. There are 36 aspects. For the most part, they translate various common adverbial phrases used in English.

Aspect is shown by the `Vn` vocalic affix in Slot VIII, but is immediately followed by a different **`Cn`** consonantal affix value than for Valence, Phase, Effect, or Level.  It is this different set of **`Cn`** affix values which distinguish the 36 `Vn` Aspect affixes from the 36 `Vn` affixes associated with Valence, Phase, Effect, and Level.  The alternate **`Cn`** affix values are as follows:

    FAC  -**h** -  becomes - **w** - or - **y** -              ASM  - **hr** -  becomes - **hrw** -                  COU  - **hn** -  becomes - ** hnw** -

    SUB  -**hl** -  becomes - **hw** -                     SPC  - **hm** -  becomes - ** hmw** -               HYP  - **hň** -  becomes - **hňw** -

The 36 Aspects are detailed below.

| **5.6.1** | **RTR** | **  Retrospective** |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |

This aspect operates in conjunction with Extension (see Sec. 3.4) to create various equivalents to Western tense categories. With the DELIMITIVE, the RETROSPECTIVE implies that a state/act/event/situation is now over or completed, thus translating the simple past tense of English or certain restricted uses of the English prsent perfect forms ‘has been’ or ‘has done’ as in  *I’ve done it* . When used with the PROXIMAL, the RETROSPECTIVE implies the state/act/event/situation was occurring in the past but may still be occurring in the present, translatable as ‘has been (doing) and may still be (doing)’. With NOMIC and ABSTRACT perspectives, it adds a sense of ‘and it’s always been that way’ to the verb.  See Sec. 5.7 below for further specific combinations of the RETROSPECTIVE with other Extensions or Aspects.

| **5.6.2** | **PRS** | **    Prospective** |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |

Like the RETROSPECTIVE above, this aspect operates in conjunction with Extension to create various equivalents to Western tense categories. With the DELIMITIVE, the PROSPECTIVE translates the simple future tense of English. When used with the PROXIMAL, the RETROSPECTIVE implies the state/act/event/situation will be occurring in the future and may already be occurring in the present, translatable as ‘will be/do and may already be (doing)’. With NOMIC and ABSTRACT perspectives, it adds a sense of ‘and will always be (doing)’ to the verb.  See Sec. 5.7 below for further specific combinations of the RETROSPECTIVE with other Extensions or Aspects.

| **5.6.3** | **HAB** | **   Habitual** |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |

This aspect conveys the idea of ‘always’ or ‘continues to’.  When combined with the RETROSPECTIVE aspect (from Sec. 5.6.1 above), the English ‘used to’ construction offers an equivalent translation, as in  *She used to come see me on Wednesdays* . When combined with the PROSPECTIVE aspect (from Sec. 5.6.2 above), the translation becomes ‘will now be (doing)’.  See Sec. 5.7 below for further specific combinations of the HABITUAL with other Extensions or Aspects.

**5.7  [Conveying “Tense”-Like ]()Information**

It is natural for speakers of English or other Western languages to expect New Ithkuil morpholoy to provide equivalents to verb “tenses” such as past, present, future, as well as various “perfective” or “imperfective” aspectual forms, in order to denote when/where an act/event/state takes place on a progressive linear timeline in relation to either the contextual “present moment” or in relation to a second, separate act/event/state.  Nevertheless, while New Ithkuil has morphology which does more or less convey such tense-like information, such morphology is generally optional and is usually unnecessary, as it is often either inferred by the contextual logic of the situation being described by the sentence, or, more importantly, is often irrelevant to an understanding of the semantic content of the sentence.  Unlike Western languages whose grammars require that verbs denote a tense, sentences in New Ithkuil  only specify such temporal information if it is genuinely necessary for the proper comprehension of the sentence’s context.  If a sentence can convey its communicative point without the need for extraneous specification as to “when” it takes place, then no such temporal information is specified.

As an example, compare the following two similar Ithkuil sentences which differ only in the subtle choice between using CONCLUSIVE aspect versus CULMINATIVE aspect.

**Ätrulaöwá  dře  Hakšivé-Warswi’a.**

CPT-‘translative.motion’-DYN- *[*  *default `Ca` ]-*  **CCL** -OBS   2p+1m/DET-ABS    CONCATENATED:‘clown’-OBJ-N-COR-PARENT:*[* *default `Ca` ]-* PRC-‘planet’-LOC

*‘We’ve ended up on the Clown Planet.’*

**Ätruleowá  dře  Hakšivé-Warswi’a.**

CPT-‘translative.motion’-DYN- *[*  *default `Ca` ]-*  **CUL** -OBS   2p+1m/DET-ABS    CONCATENATED:‘clown’-OBJ-N-COR-PARENT:*[* *default `Ca` ]-* PRC-‘planet’-LOC

*‘We eventually wound up on the Clown Planet.’*

Notice that the translation of the first sentence utilizes the English “present perfect” tense (i.e., “have” + past participle) while the second sentence is translated using simple past tense.  Yet the intralinear analysis of both New ithkuil sentences shows that neither one of them specifies any “tense” informtion whatsoever whether past, present, future, or any equivalent to Western “perfective” forms.  So why the differing choices of tense when translating these two sentences into English?

In the absense of any morphology specifically denoting a temporal position along a progressive linear timeline, a New Ithkuil sentence is considered to be describing something as manifesting/taking place in the speaker’s (and addressee’s) contextual present moment.  So the first sentence is indicating that at the present moment the speaker and addressee find themselves on the Clown Planet.  However, the use of CONCLUSIVE aspect indicates that the particular present state of affairs has arisen as the result of events during the short time immediately prior to the present moment.  The English present perfect tense is convenient in conveying such a situation where the act/event/state in the present moment is a direct outcome of the immediately preceding short-term events (where those preceding short-term events can be considers part of a larger “present”-tense context.

In the second sentence, however, use of the CULMINATIVE aspect implies that the present state of affairs is the outcome of a long drawn-out process or series of events extending back into the past, so that rather than the preceding events being short-term and considered part of a larger “present” context, here the present moment is seen as being part of a larger “past” context.  Consequently, the semantics of the second New Ithkuil sentence are better translated into English using the past tense.

**5.7.1   ****Combinations of Aspect, Extension, and Perspetive**

Despite the discussion above explaining why conveying “tense”-like information in New Ithkuil is both optional and unusual, nevertheless, the language does provide morphology to do so, if necessary.  The following Aspect + Extension or Aspect + Aspect combinations constitute formalized/conventionalized indicators of “tense”-like information on a verb:

| **RTR** Aspect + **DEL** Extension = ‘has been / has done’**RTR** Aspect + **PRX** Extension = ‘has been (doing) [and may still be (doing)]’**RTR** Aspect + **ICP** Extension = ‘began to be’ / ‘began doing’**RTR** Aspect + **ATV** Extension = ‘finished being / finished doing’**RTR** Aspect + **GRA** Extension = ‘gradually developed into being/doing’**RTR** Aspect + **DPL**  Extension  = ‘gradually stopped being/doing & is/does no longer**RTR** Aspect + **PCS** Aspect = ‘just now finished being/doing’**RTR** + **HAB** Aspects + **DEL** Extension = ‘used to be/do but no longer’**RTR** + **HAB** Aspects + **PRX** Extension = ‘used to be/do and may still be (doing)’ | **PRS** Aspect + **DEL** Extension =  simple future tense**PRS** Aspect + **PRX** Extension = ‘will be/do & may already be (doing)’**PRS** Aspect + **ICP** Extension = ‘will begin to be’ / ‘will start doing’**PRS** Aspect + **ATV** Extension = ‘will finish being/doing’**PRS** Aspect + **GRA** Extension = ‘will develop into being/doing’**PRS** Aspect + **DPL** Extension = ‘will gradually stop being/doing’**PRS** Aspect + **PCS** Aspect = ‘just about to be/do’**PRS** + **RTR** Aspects = ‘will have’ (e.g.,  *By then he will have done it* .)**PRS** + **HAB** Aspects + **DEL** Extension = ‘will now be (doing) but not yet’ |

**5.7.2  The TPP and RTI Affixes**

The **TPP** affix is available to specify a point or span on a past-present-future progressive timeline:

| -**kt** | **TPP***  **Temporal Position Relative to Present **            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | in the remote past, once upon a time                                  |
| 2             | past/former/previous; once [e.g., I was young once], a long time ago  |
| 3             | recent; recently                                                      |
| 4             | . . . just past / just (happened)                                     |
| 5             | present/current/present day; now / at present / presently / currently |
| 6             | imminent; just about to / about to / on the verge of                  |
| 7             | forthcoming / soon to arrive; soon                                    |
| 8             | future / -- to be / --to come / eventual(ly); someday...              |
| 9             | in the remote future / far in the future / long after we’re gone     |

Additionally, the **RTI** affix specifies when an event occurs relative to another event or relative to the contextual “present” of an utterance.  This affix may be used on its own or in conjunction with the **TPP** affix to provide specific tense-like information.  (See [**Chapter 7**](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_07_affixes.htm) on how to construct and use Affixes on a formative.)

Example of the **RTI** affix:

**Yiţxirňiexnalté   wialmya.**

PRX-STEM2/CPT-‘evolve’-EPC₁/4-PZE³/2- **RTI₁/1** -PUP          *[*  *default `Ca` ]-* N-‘flowering.plant’-THM

*‘Flowering plants had not yet developed / were yet to develop during the Cambrian geological period* *(but they have developed since).’*

**5.8  [Moving the C ~N~ –Pattern]() 1 Mood/Case-Scope affix to the Slot VI `Ca` Slot**

If the **V~N~`Cn` **affix values in Slot VIII shows default MNO Valence (- **a** -) and a Mood/Case-Scope other than FAC or CCN - **h** -, then `Vn` may be elided and the **`Cn` **affix may instead be shown in Slot VI (the `Ca` Slot) under the following circumstance:   if `Ca` in Slot VI is default - **l** - ( **CSL-UPX-DEL-M-NRM** ), then the `Ca` in Slot VI may be replaced by the Mood/Case-Scope **`Cn`** affix, thus shortening the word by one syllable.  Note that the **C ~N~ –Pattern 1** affix FAC/CCN - **h** - never moves to Slot VI because it instead elides whenever Slot VIII is zero-marked.

The following example shows the same formative with and without movement of the **C ~N~ –Pattern 1** affix from Slot VIII to Slot VI:

| **Äňvyulahlâ.**CPT-‘apply.varnish’-DYN-[default `Ca` ]-MNO-SUB-REC*‘Varnish might’ve been applied.’ / ‘It might be varnished.’* | **Äňvyuhlâ.**CPT-‘apply.varnish’-DYN-SUB-REC*‘Varnish might’ve been applied.’ / ‘It might be varnished.’* |
