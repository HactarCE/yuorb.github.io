## 5.0 动词形态 {#Sec5}


构形词，在句中如动词而非如名词发挥作用时，可能展示一些额外形态范畴，它们不见于名词，包含配价、语式、相位、级别、效果及时体，每个在下文第 5.1-5.6 节介绍。所有这些范畴都通过构形词列位 VIII 中 `VnCn` 词缀展示。该 `VnCn` 词缀本身由元音形式 `Vn` 及辅音形式 `Cn` 的两个不同模式构成。其中首个模式使用标准元音序列中四个元音形式系列分别表示配价、语式、相位、级别，而辅音指语式或格辖两者择一（取决于列位 X 的重读是否在 `Vc/Vk` 音节上）。另一个模式使用相同的四个元音形式系列表示时体，与前者不同的是，使用另一套不同的 `Cn` 辅音。列位 VIII `VnCn` 词缀的结构与模式如下表格所示：

## 5.1 配价 {#Sec5_1}

语法术语<strong>配价</strong>指两个分离的实体/一方在任意给定动词的参与方式，即一方的参与自动意味着另一方以共动、各动或补动方式参与同一行为、事件或状态。这种双重参与在世界语言的动词中自然存在，是所谓的<tooltip label="“coactive” verb">「共同活动」动词</tooltip>的范畴。虽然所有的语言都隐示共同活动动词，但 New Ithkuil 以形式和系统的方式明示了这种双重参与。为了说明英语中的<tooltip label="coactivity">共同活动性</tooltip>概念，请比较以下几对句子：

(1a)<q>I found an old man.</q>（我发现一个老人） → (1b)<q>I found an empty can.</q>（我发现一个空罐头）
(2a)<q>I threw the ball at Sam.</q>（我将球扔向山姆） → (2b)<q>I threw the ball at the window.</q>（我将球扔向窗户）
(3a)<q>I performed in front of her.</q>（我在她面前表演） → (3b)<q>I performed in front of the wall.</q>（我在墙壁面前表演）

注意每对句的首句包含动词有生性宾语（<q>an old man</q>、<q>Sam</q>、<q>her</q>），而其次句有无生性宾语（<q>an empty can</q>、<q>the window</q>、<q>the wall</q>）。现在比较下面这组相似句对：

(1c)<q>I met an old man.</q>（我遇到一个老人） → (1d)*<q>I met an empty can.</q>（我遇到一个空罐头）
(2c)<q>I threw Sam the ball.</q>（我将球扔给山姆） → (2d)*<q>I threw the window the ball.</q>（我将球扔给窗户）
(3c)<q>I entertained her.</q>（我供她娱乐） → (3d)*<q>I entertained the wall.</q>（我供墙壁娱乐）

星号 \* 表示该句对于操英语者语义上不可接受。为什么呢？这组句对与首组句对相似，仅仅是将动词从 <q>find</q>、<q>throw at</q>、<q>perform</q> 替换成语义上相近的<q>meet</q>、<q>throw</q>、<q>entertain</q>。然而，给这后三个动词应用无生性宾语似乎不可接受。原因是首组中的动词具有「<tooltip label="monoactive">单独活动</tooltip>」性质，即它们不要求宾语以任何方式参与行动，而第二组中的动词具有<tooltip label="coactive">共同活动</tooltip>性质，要求宾语与主语一起参与行动。因此，这是可行的：我「发现」一个老人，老人却不做任何事情，甚至没察觉到；而这是不可行的：我「遇见」一个老人，而老人却不遇见我。我可以在山姆没察觉到的情况下「将球扔向」山姆，但是如果我「将球扔给」山姆，就意味着他要通过接球来参与。

同样，我可以在某人面前表演，即使他睡着了；但我不能供其娱乐，除非他通过观察我参与于该情况中。涉及共同活动动词第二方的参与性关系因语境不同而不同。它可以是一种共动关系（即双方都参与），如英语副词<q>together</q>在<q>He and I jog together</q>中所暗示的那样，也可以是一种互动关系，如句子<q>I met the old man</q>（即，他也遇到了我），或者在动词中使用副词短语<q>each other</q>，如<q>We love each other</q>中。这种关系可以是一种伴随关系，如「我陪他演奏」（例如，他唱歌），也可以是一种补动关系，如「我将球扔给山姆」（即，于是他接住了球）。

其他类型的共同活动关系也是可能的。正是这些关系的差异，在 New Ithkuil 中系统化为名为配价的范畴。在英语和其他语言中，共同活动性很少是明示和系统的（使用副词如<q>together</q>、<q>each other</q>或前缀如<q>out-perform</q>中的<q>out-</q>是一些例外），当对动词本身内词汇化时，隐含着该动词的特殊性，产生了单独活动/共同活动对，如<q>find/meet</q>、<q>throw at/throw</q>、<q>perform/entertain</q> 等等。在 New Ithkuil 中，共同活动性在形态上明示，以及共同活动关系的类型，即动词的配价，对所有动词来说都是系统的且全功能的。因此，没有必要在词汇上区分单独活动性与共同活动性，即所有动词都可以发挥单独活动性和共同活动性的功能。

New Ithkuil 有九种配价：独动价、共动价、各动价、互动价、补动价、复动价、示动价、接动价、参动价。配价以构形词列位 VIII 中元音性 `Vn` 词缀表示。注意 `Vn` 词缀的存在与否取决于其后表示语式（见下[第 5.2 节](05#Sec5_2)）或格辖（见[第 4.10 节](04#Sec4_10)）之一的 `Cn` 词缀是否存在。九种配价如下解释。

### 5.1.1 MNO 独动价 {#Sec5_1_1}

独动价是默认配价，表示无共同活动，即无暗示第二方的参与

</div>

### 5.1.2 PRL 共动价 {#Sec5_1_2}

共动价表示第二方同一时间如第一方参与同一种活动。可翻译句子<q>The children all sang together</q>（孩子们一起唱）、<q>We both went jogging on the parkway</q>（我俩在大路上一起慢步跑）。

### 5.1.3 CRO 各动价 {#Sec5_1_3}

各动价类似共动价，但第二方同一时间如第一方参与相关活动，而非同一种活动。可翻译句子<q>The children played in the yard</q>（孩子们在庭院玩，即每个参与不同类型的「玩」活动）或<q>The band played my favorite song</q>（乐队演奏了我最喜爱的歌，即乐队每个成员用不同的乐器而有人主唱）

### 5.1.4 RCP 互动价 {#Sec5_1_4}

互动价表示每一方向对方做相同活动，反之亦然，因此翻译成英语副词短语<q>each other</q>和<q>one another</q>，如<q>The clown and the grocer despise one another</q>（小丑和食品商互相瞧不起）。但要注意的是，在互动价关系中的两方由一个指称所指明的句子中，动词往往需要应指称使用 `SBS` 词缀，以表示所指明的指称中的不同方参与了互动价关系，否则，所指明的一方将视为整体，构成互动价活动的一「方」（如下例）。

</div>

### 5.1.5 CPL 补动价 {#Sec5_1_5}

补动价表示第二方补充第一方的活动。「补动价」暗示着由不同于第一方活动的活动，但对完成整个联合活动是必要的，也就是联合活动的「另一半」。这在诸如句子<q>The man and his son played catch</q>（男人和他儿子玩传球）、<q>Hortense took me into the woods</q>（霍尔滕斯把我带进树林）、<q>The clown read the children a story</q>（小丑给孩子们讲故事）、<q>My back itches so I scratch it</q>（我背痒所以我挠它）中得到了体现，其中<q>played catch</q>意味着扔球+接球的互补性活动，<q>take (in the woods)</q>意味着有人带领而另一人跟随，<q>read</q>意味着有人讲述和有人倾听，而<q>itches</q>则暗示着挠。

</div>

### 5.1.6 DUP 复动价 {#Sec5_1_6}

复动价表示第二方复制或重复第一方的活动，如句子<q>Let’s draw a picture</q>（一起画幅画，即我先画它，然后你画同一幅）、<q>They both read that book</q>（他俩读那本书，即一个先读，一个后读）、<q>I bought a new car</q>（我买了一辆新车，即现在有其他人也买了新车）。

</div>

### 5.1.7 DEM 示动价 {#Sec5_1_7}

示动价表示第一方向第二方演示如何做某件事或要做某件事。因此，一个 New Ithkuil 句子构造为「我们下棋」，动词为示动价，意思是「我向他展示了如何下棋」，而构造为「他们与我们战斗」的句子使用示动价的意思是「他们教我们如何战斗」。

<div class="indent">

    <div class="expln">一对孩子在地板上，一个正在向另一个展示如何玩（一个游戏）。</div>
</div>

### 5.1.8 CNG 接动价 {#Sec5_1_8}

接动价表示第二方参与一个多部分活动的下一个或从属性的阶段，具体活动取决于语境。如：「我给朋友生起篝火」用接动价，意味着朋友接着进行下一个逻辑步骤，即煮食物。

<div class="indent">
    <dl class="gloss">

    <div class="expln">一对孩子在地板上玩，一个参与游戏活动的一个部分，然后另一个参与下一个部分。</div>
</div>

### 5.1.9 PTI 参动价 {#Sec5_1_9}

参动价表示多方参与的活动涉及一个更大的整体，即「参加」。因此，「他们赛跑」用参动价，意味着他们各自参加赛跑。


<div class="indent">

## 5.2 语式 {#Sec5_2}

Most languages have a morphological category for verbs known as “mood,” serving to indicate specific attitudes or perspectives on the act, condition, or event, or the degree of factuality involved. Example moods common to Western languages include the indicative (factual utterances), subjunctive (showing doubt or probability, expressed by <q>may/might</q> in English), imperative (indicating commands, e.g., <q>Go now!</q>, <q>Sing it for us!</q> ), conditional (expressing hypotheticals, e.g., <q>She would travel if she could</q> ), optative (indicating wishes, hopes, expectations, e.g., <q>I wish he’d go</q>, <q>I expect him to be here</q> ), and hortative (indicating exhortations, e.g., <q>May he live 100 years!</q>, <q>Let them see for themselves!</q> ).

In New Ithkuil, moods simply convey a twofold distinction as to whether the factuality of an utterance is certain or uncertain, combined with a threeway distinction as to whether the factuality of an explicit or implicit assumption underlying the utterance (i.e., a presupposition) is true, false, or unknown. This twofold by threefold matrix renders a total of six moods: the FACTUAL , SUBJUNCTIVE , ASSUMPTIVE , SPECULATIVE , COUNTERFACTIVE , and HYPOTHETICaL, explained below.

Mood is shown via the `Cn` affix in Slot VIII, immediately following the `Vn` affix. Note that this is the same affix that shows CaseScope in nominal formatives (i.e., nouns), as already described in Sec. 4.10. The determination as to whether a formative is a noun or verb can be made by its syllabic stress pattern. For our purposes here, verbal formatives where the `Cn` affix in Slot VIII shows Mood will always be stressed on the final syllable of the word. This is explained in detail in [Sec. 6.2.1](06.htm#Sec6_2_1) on Relation.

### 5.2.1 FAC The Factual {#Sec5_2_1}

The FACTUAL mood is the default mood and is unmarked if Slot VIII is otherwise unfilled/unmarked. Otherwise, it is marked by the `Cn` affix h in Slot VIII. The FACTUAL mood signifies that the factuality of the speaker’s statement is certain and that there either is no underlying presupposition to the statement, or if there is, its factuality is also certain or has no bearing on the factuality of the statement. Examples:

Yuçká elari.

*PRX.STEM3/PRC* *‘suffer.from.illness’ FAC OBS STEM2/PRC‘child’GAFF*

*‘Their kids are ill’.* [i.e., it is known he has kids and it is known they are ill]

*CONCaTENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC‘selfinvolved.leisure.activity’PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’[default `Ca` ]TPP₁/7PRLFACOBS ma/BEN+1m/BENACT*

*‘She and I are (planning on) taking a walk later on’. * [i.e., it is our intention and we have the opportunity to do so]

*[* *default `Ca` ]STEM2/PRC‘be.insideout’ FAC OBS PRC‘article.of.clothing’ASO/MDCTHM STEM3/PRC‘spouse’OBJ[default `Ca` ]GID₁/1POS ma/BENGEN*

*‘His wife’s clothes are insideout.’*

### 5.2.2 SUB The Subjunctive {#Sec5_2_2}

The SUBJUNCTIVE mood is marked by the `Cn` affix hl in Slot VIII. It indicates that the factuality of an explicit or implicit presupposition underlying the statement is certain, but the factuality of the speaker’s statement itself is questionable or uncertain, the specific nuance of factuality intended being subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Corresponds roughly with English ‘may,’ ‘maybe’ or ‘might,’ with the added distinction that an explicit or implicit (i.e., underlying) presupposition is true. Examples:

Yuçkahlá elari.

*PRXSTEM3/PRC* *‘suffer.from.illness’ SUB OBS STEM2/PRC‘child’GAFF*

*‘Maybe his kids are ill.’* [i.e., it is known that he has kids but it is not known whether they are ill]
Hlešviegaloktählá pra’i.

*CONCaTENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC‘selfinvolved.leisure.activity’PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’[default `Ca` ]TPP₁/7PRLSUBOBS ma/BEN+1m/BENACT*

*‘She and I may take a walk later on.’ * [i.e., it is known that the opportunity to do so will arise, but it is uncertain whether we will choose to]

*[* *default `Ca` ]STEM2/PRC‘be.insideout’ SUB OBS PRC‘article.of.clothing’ASO/MDCTHM STEM3/PRC‘spouse’OBJ[default `Ca` ]GID₁/1POS ma/BENGEN*

*‘His wife’s clothes may be insideout.’*

### 5.2.3 ASM The Assumptive {#Sec5_2_3}

The ASSUMPTIVE mood is marked by the `Cn` affix hr in Slot VIII. It functions identically to the FACTUAL except that the factuality of an underlying presupposition is unknown. It therefore conveys an act, state, or event whose factuality is dependent on whether something else is factual, thus corresponding to certain usages of English ‘maybe’ and ‘will’ (where ‘will’ primarily conveys possibility, not future tense). As with all moods, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Examples:
Yuçkahrú elari.

*PRXSTEM3/PRC* *‘suffer.from.illness’ ASM INF STEM2/PRC‘child’GAFF*

*‘His kids’ll be ill* OR If he has kids, they are ill.’* [i.e., it is unknown whether he has kids, but if he does, they are certainly ill.]
Hlešviegaloktährá pra’i.

*CONCaTENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC‘selfinvolved.leisure.activity’PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’[default `Ca` ]TPP₁/7PRLASMOBS ma/BEN+1m/BENACT*

*‘She and I will take a walk later on’* [i.e., if we can] OR ‘*We intend to take a walk’.* [i.e., but we don’t know if we’ll be able to]
Webglahrû afbalfa umflilacai pei.

*[* *default `Ca` ]STEM2/PRC‘be.insideout’ ASM ITU PRC‘article.of.clothing’ASO/MDCTHM STEM3/PRC‘spouse’OBJ[default `Ca` ]GID₁/1POS ma/BENGEN*

*‘If he has a wife her clothes are insideout.’*

NOTE: In the examples immediately above, an astute reader will notice that in addition to the shift in Mood to ASSUMPTIVE, the Validation of the verb (see [Sec. 6.1.2](06.htm#Sec6_1_2)) may have to change as well — since the factuality of the underlying assumption is now suspect, the basis for the speaker’s knowledge of the event is not their own empirical observation, but rather becomes based on intuition, inference, etc., which must be reflected by the Validation category. This is true for the remaining three Moods as well.

### 5.2.4 SPC The Speculative {#Sec5_2_4}

The SPECULATIVE mood is marked by the `Cn` affix hm in Slot VIII. It indicates that the factuality of both the presupposition and the statement itself are unknown. Its translation into English is dependent on the specific context, sometimes corresponding to ‘may,’ ‘maybe’ or ‘might,’ and at other times corresponding to the auxiliary ‘would.’ Compare the examples below to those above:
Yuçkahmû elari.

*PRXSTEM3/PRC* *‘suffer.from.illness’ SPC ITU STEM2/PRC‘child’GAFF*

*‘Maybe his kids are ill.’ * [i.e., it is unknown if he has kids but if he does, they may be ill]
Hlešviegaloktähmû pra’i.

*CONCaTENATED/[* *default `Ca` ]:STEM2/PRC‘selfinvolved.leisure.activity’PUR+PARENT:‘ambulation’[default `Ca` ]TPP₁/7PRLSPCITU ma/BEN+1m/BENACT*

*‘She and I may take a walk later on.’ * [i.e., it is unknown whether we will have the opportunity to do so, and even if we do, it is uncertain whether we will choose to]

*‘If he has a wife her clothes may be insideout.’*

### 5.2.5 COU The Counterfactive {#Sec5_2_5}

The COUNTERFACTIVE mood is marked by the `Cn` affix hn in Slot VIII. It indicates that the factuality of the underlying presupposition is false or unreal but that the factuality of the statement would otherwise be true. It thus corresponds to the English construction of auxiliary ‘would’ or ‘would have’ in its use to show counterfactuality (i.e., what would have been if a false presupposition had been true). Again, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Compare the examples below to those above.
Yuçkahnú elari.

*PRXSTEM3/PRC* *‘suffer.from.illness’ COU INF STEM2/PRC‘child’GAFF*

*‘His kids would be (would have been) ill.’ * [i.e., if he had kids they would be ill, but he doesn’t]

*‘If he were to have a wife her clothes would be insideout.’*

### 5.2.6 HYP The Hypothetical {#Sec5_2_6}

The HYPOTHETICaL mood is marked by the `Cn` affix h ň in Slot VIII. It indicates that the factuality of the underlying presupposition is false or unreal and that the factuality of the statement itself would nevertheless be uncertain even if the underlying presupposition were true. It thus corresponds to the English construction of auxiliary ‘might have’ in its use to show possible counterfactuality (i.e., what might have been if a false presupposition had been true). Again, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Compare the examples below to those above.

## 5.3 相位 {#Sec5_3}

Phase refers to variances in the temporal pattern of how an act, condition or event occurs, e.g., in a momentary, lasting, or repetitive manner (or lack thereof). This is especially useful in describing phenomena that occur in sudden bursts of short duration, e.g., flashing, sputtering, blinking, alternating, etc. Phase functions closely with the morphological category of Extension, previously described in Sec. 3.4, to specify the durational nature, starting and ending, and operative pattern of a state, action or event. Phase is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII. The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence above, i.e., showing Valence and Phase via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Valence, it cannot show Phase, and viceversa. (Note that it is possible to show either Valence or Phase on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.) The nine Phases are PUNCTUAL , ITERATIVE , REPETITIVE , INTERMITTENT , RECURRENT , FREQUENTATIVE , FRAGMENTATIVE , VACILLITATIVE , and FLUCTUATIVE, described below.

### 5.3.1 PUN The Punctual {#Sec5_3_1}

The PUNCTUAL Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value ai in Slot VIII. It describes an act, condition, or event which is pointlike, momentary or instantaneous in nature, such as an explosion, a flash of lightning, a blow, a single handclap, a collision between two objects, a stab of pain, a single cough, the clicking of a lock, etc. It can be visually represented along a timeline by a single point, e.g., •

*‘The alien device (has) emitted a single short beeping sound.’*

### 5.3.2 ITR The Iterative {#Sec5_3_2}

The ITERATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value au in Slot VIII. It refers to a momentary or instantaneous event, like the PUNCTUAL above, which repeats itself in a rapid, on/off, staccato manner, like a machine gun burst, strobe light burst, an alarm bell ringing, or the quick unconscious tapping of a finger, the whole considered as a single event.

### 5.3.3 REP The Repetitive {#Sec5_3_3}

The REPETITIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value ei in Slot VIII. It refers to a relatively brief event of indeterminate or vague duration but repeated in an on/off staccato manner, like a car horn being honked repeatedly in a fast steady rhythm, or an automatic machine press. Visual representation: — — — —

### 5.3.4 ITM The Intermittent {#Sec5_3_4}

The INTERMITTENT Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value eu in Slot VIII. It is similar to the ITERATIVE above, identifying a repetitive occurrence of a PUNCTUAL event, however, unlike the ITERATIVE, the duration of time between repetitions is relatively long and contextually relevant. It would be used in describing the downbeat pattern of a pop song, the ongoing snapping of fingers to music, the steady onedropatatime dripping of a faucet, etc. Visual representation: • — • — • — •

### 5.3.5 RCT The Recurrent {#Sec5_3_5}

The RECURRENT Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value ëu in Slot VIII. It is to the REPETITIVE as the INTERMITTENT is to the ITERATIVE. It indicates a slow repetition of an event, where the duration between occurrences is relatively long and contextually relevant. Exemplified by the sounding of a foghorn, or the ongoing hooting of an owl. Visual representation: ——* ——— ——— ——— —

### 5.3.6 FRE The Frequentative {#Sec5_3_6}

The FREQUENTATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value ou in Slot VIII. It indicates an iterative occurrence (a single set of punctual repetitions) which in turn repeats at intervals, the whole considered as a single event. Examples would be the repetitive sets of hammerings of a woodpecker or the repeated short bursts of a jackhammer. Visual representation: — • • •— • • •— • • •— • • •

### 5.3.7 FRG The Fragmentative {#Sec5_3_7}

The FRAGMENTATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value oi in Slot VIII. It indicates a random pattern of punctual occurrences, the whole considered as a single event. Visual representation: —— • •— • • • ——• • —• • • • •—— • —• •

### 5.3.8 VAC The Vacillitative {#Sec5_3_8}

The VACILLITATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value iu in Slot VIII. It functions as a nonpunctual counterpart to the FRAGMENTATIVE, i.e., with a pattern such visually illustrated as: — – – — — — – — – — —

### 5.3.9 FLC The Fluctuative {#Sec5_3_9}

The FLUCTUATIVE Phase is shown by the `Vn` affix value ui in Slot VIII. It indicates a random pattern of both punctual and longer occurrences. An example would be the “sputtering” of a lighted fuse, the random patterns of tongues of flames, the chirping of birds in the wild, etc. Visual representation:—

## 5.4 效果 {#Sec5_4}

The category of Effect indicates whether a formative is beneficial or detrimental to a particular party. There is also a neutral or “unknown” value for Effect that indicates neither benefit nor detriment. Effect is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII. Effect may also be indicated using a `VxCs` affix, an affixual adjunct, or via a Referential. Absence of Effect is equivalent to Neutral Effect, i.e., no statement about the Effect is being made (e.g., because Effect is shown elsewhere in the sentence on a different formative or via a Referential or modular adjunct).

The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence or Phase above, i.e., showing Valence, Phase or Effect via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are all mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Effect, it cannot show Valence or Phase. (Note that it is possible to show either Valence or Phase or Effect on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.) The nine Effects are described below, with examples of their use shown in Sec. 5.4.10.

### 5.4.1 1:BEN Beneficial to Speaker {#Sec5_4_1}

BENEFICIAL TO SPEAKER Effect is shown by a `Vn` affix value of ia (or uä if immediately preceded by a y ) in Slot VIII. It indicates that the formative is of benefit to the firstperson speaker of the sentence.

## 5.5 级别 {#Sec5_5}

Level corresponds roughly to what is known as degree of comparison in other languages. Many languages morphologically indicate degrees of comparison as exemplified by the English suffixes *er* and *est* seen in *greatgreatergreatest* , or alternately with the adverbs *more* and *most* , as well as their negative counterparts *less* and *least* . The New Ithkuil comparison schema is much more complex than those found in natural languages and is designed to eliminate various ambiguities that arise from those simpler schemata, as discussed below.

### 5.5.1 Ambiguity and UnderSpecification in Natural Languages {#Sec5_5_1}

The comparison schemata of natural languages tend to grossly underspecify the exact semantic nature of the comparison. A clear case of such underspecification can be seen in an English example sentence such as *Jane is healthier.* This sentence can mean any of the following:

*1. Jane's state of health has improved, although she is still unwell.*

2. *Jane's state of health has improved so that now she is well (whereas before she was unwell).*

*3. Jane's state of health is even better than it previously was (i.e., she was healthy before, but is even healthier now).*

*4. Jane's state of health is not as poor as someone else's state of health (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).*

*5. Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, so that Jane can be considered healthy while the other is unwell.*

6. *Jane's state of health is better than someone else's state of health, even though both can be considered healthy.*

This ambiguity is not alleviated even when we specify a party to which Jane's health is being compared as in *Jane is healthier than Sue* , which can mean:

*a) Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's although both are unwell.*

*b) Jane's state of health is better than Sue's, so that Jane can be considered well while Sue is unwell.*

*c) Both Jane and Sue are healthy, but Jane's state of health is even better than Sue's.*

*d) Jane's state of health is not as poor as Sue's (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).*

This sort of ambiguity allows oddsounding sentences such as *Snow is warmer * (e.g., than liquid nitrogen) to be perfectly grammatical. What is important to note about the above analysis is that the words *healthier* or *warmer* do not indicate in the actual context of usage *whether a person is actually healthy or whether snow is actually warm.* Rather English *er* and *est* (and *more* and *most* ) as well as their negative counterparts (*less* and *least* ) merely serve to indicate *on a relative scale* a relationship between two entities being compared (or where only one party is mentioned, in relationship to some unspecified standard or expectation). Additional statements are needed to clarify the actual context to determine where the entities fall on the quantitative "spectrum" or range of the particular quality or attribute pair in question, e.g., *unhealthy * <—> *healthy* .

The New Ithkuil comparison scheme inherently specifies such relative comparison while simultaneously specifying placement within the qualitative spectrum, so that ambiguity as to whether “healthier” means the person is well or unwell is eliminated.

### 5.5.2 Relative Versus Absolute Comparison {#Sec5_5_2}

An additional aspect of New Ithkuil comparison is the concept of relative comparison versus absolute comparison . This is an important concept which impacts the truth value of a statement based upon context. Specifically, relative comparison allows for statements to be true within the narrow confines of the contextathand, whereas absolute comparison allows for statements to be true without reference to any specific context. This can be illustrated by the following examples.

*a) Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.*

*b) That highway is the fastest way into town.*

Both of these sentences are true in certain pragmatic contexts and not true in others. For example, while Sirius is the most luminous star as seen from Earth, this is merely due to its relative nearness to Earth (8.4 light years) as compared to most other stars. There are thousands of known stars which are larger (and inherently more luminous) than Sirius but are much further away from Earth. So Sentence (a) is true in a relative context but false in an absolute context. Similarly the highway in Sentence (b) may be the fastest way in most conditions, but if there is a traffic jam or an accident blocking the highway, or if one has access to a private helicopter, then the statement would be false. Therefore, it is only true in a narrow context determined by the pragmatics of the moment it is spoken. New Ithkuil allows speakers to specify whether a comparison is to be interpreted within the contextathand (relative comparison) or as an absolute statement irrespective of the contextathand.

### 5.5.3 Comparison Operators (Levels) {#Sec5_5_3}

There are nine comparison operators for the Ithkuil verb, called Levels, which specify the comparative relationship involved, e.g., *same as, more than, less than* , etc. Relative Level is shown by the vocalic `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII. The nine `Vn` values showing Phase are different than those showing Valence, Phase, or Effect above, i.e., showing Valence, Phase, Effect or Level via the `Vn` affix value in Slot VIII are all mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Level, it cannot show Valence, Phase or Effect. (Note that it is possible to show these categories on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.) The nine Effects are described below, with examples of their use shown in Sec. 5.5.4.

In interpreting the meaning of the various Levels, the terms used in the formulas below refer to the following XM(Y) model, where M represents a verb or an adjectival description, X is the "subject" of the verb, and Y is the standard being compared to.

Sue dances as well as /``dances better than /``dances worse than``etc. Mary OR Sue is as smart``is smarter than``is less smart than``etc. Mary

X M (Y) X M (Y)

Note that the meaning of each Level allows for an interpretation in which there is no Y term so that the standard of comparison is a previous state of X, e.g., the difference between *Sue dances better than Mary* versus *Sue dances better than before* .

Label Name of Level `Vn` affix value (RELATIVE COMPARISON ONLY) Meaning

MIN MINIMAL ao X M’s at its least possible / X is at its least M possible
SBE SUBEQUATIVE aö X M’s less than or = to Y ( or than or equal to before) / X is less M than or = to Y / before
IFR INFERIOR eo X M’s the least (or is the least M) within/among Y (or ever)
DFT DEFICIENT eö X M’s less than Y ( or than before) / X is less M than Y ( or than before)
EQU EQUATIVE oë X M’s the same as Y ( or as before) / X is as M as Y ( or as before)
SUR SURPASSIVE öe X M’s more than Y ( or than before) / X is more M than Y ( or than before)
SPL SUPERLATIVE oe X M’s the most (or is the most M) within/among Y (or ever)
SPQ SUPEREQUATIVE öa X M’s more than or = to Y ( or than or equal to before) / X is more M than or = to Y / before
MAX MAXIMAL oa X M’s at its most possible / X is at its most M possible

The VN values in Slot VIII above can only show relative Level, not absolute Level. To show Absolute Level, use a LVL affix in Type2 (see [Chapter 7 on Affixes](07.htm)) in Slot V or VII of the formative.

The following affix is applied to the “Y” noun to which something is compared (the “than Y”). The “Y” noun is declined into the COMPARATIVE case.

mt SCL Standards for Comparison for Use with Levels
1 where X was previously less M (or M’d less) than Y
2 where X was previously more M (or M’d more) than Y
3 where X is still less M (or M’s less) than Y
4 where X is still more M (or M’s more) than Y
5.where X is now less M (or M’s less) than Y
6 where X is now more M (or M’s more) than Y
7 where X was previously as M (or M’d as much) as Y
8 where X’s previous state of Mness (or level of Ming) relative to Y is unknown
9 where X’s previous state of Mness (or level of Ming) relative to Y is inapplicable or irrelevant

The exact nature of the comparison can be further specified by the following XCL affix, in order to explicitly reference an external standard or expectation of the quality being compared. The affix is applied to either the “X” noun bearing a LEVEL Comparison Operator or the “Y” noun to which something is compared (the “than Y”). The “Y” noun is declined into the COMPARATIVE Case.

çx XCL External Standard for Comparison for Use with Levels

1 ...although X (still) isn’t very M compared to some external standard or expectation of Mness
2 ...and where X now meets some external standard or expectation of Mness
3 ...and where X now exceeds some external standard or expectation of Mness
4 ...although neither X nor Y are very M compared to some external standard or expectation of Mness
5....and where both X and Y meet some external standard or expectation of Mness, where previously only Y met/exceeded it
6 ...and where both X and Y exceed some external standard or expectation of Mness, where previously only Y exceeded it
7 ...and where X’s degree of Mness exceeds that of Y, but neither is (still) very M compered to some external standard or expectation of Mness
8 ...and where X now meets some external standard or expectation of Mness and Y does not
9 ...and where X now exceeds some external standard or expectation of Mness and Y does not

Another important affix used with Levels is the COS affix to more exactly specify the nature of the comparison:

lc COS Comparison Specifications (Used with Levels )
1 “more”/“less” = extent/amount/volume
2 “harder”/“weaker” = degree of intensity or effort
3 “longer”/“shorter” = duration; time spent being/doing
4 “better”/“worse” = quality / style
5.“more efficiently”/“less efficiently” = effort relative to outcome
6 “greater”/“poorer” = relevant outcome / bottomline result
7 combination of 4, 5, and 6
8 combination of 1, 2, and 3
9 combination of 1 through 6

## 5.6 时体 {#Sec5_6}

Aspect provides detailed and specific temporal information about the verb, not in relation to the speaker’s present moment of utterance (as with Perspective in Sec. 3.3), but rather in relation to the contextual “present” of the act, condition, or event being spoken about. There are 36 aspects. For the most part, they translate various common adverbial phrases used in English.

Aspect is shown by the `Vn` vocalic affix in Slot VIII, but is immediately followed by a different `Cn` consonantal affix value than for Valence, Phase, Effect, or Level. It is this different set of `Cn` affix values which distinguish the 36 `Vn` Aspect affixes from the 36 `Vn` affixes associated with Valence, Phase, Effect, and Level. The alternate `Cn` affix values are as follows:

FAC h becomes w or y ASM hr becomes hrw COU hn becomes hnw

SUB hl becomes hw SPC hm becomes hmw HYP hň becomes hňw

The 36 Aspects are detailed below.

### 5.6.1 RTR Retrospective {#Sec5_6_1}

This aspect operates in conjunction with Extension (see Sec. 3.4) to create various equivalents to Western tense categories. With the DELIMITIVE, the RETROSPECTIVE implies that a state/act/event/situation is now over or completed, thus translating the simple past tense of English or certain restricted uses of the English prsent perfect forms ‘has been’ or ‘has done’ as in *I’ve done it* . When used with the PROXIMAL, the RETROSPECTIVE implies the state/act/event/situation was occurring in the past but may still be occurring in the present, translatable as ‘has been (doing) and may still be (doing)’. With NOMIC and ABSTRACT perspectives, it adds a sense of ‘and it’s always been that way’ to the verb. See Sec. 5.7 below for further specific combinations of the RETROSPECTIVE with other Extensions or Aspects.

Like the RETROSPECTIVE above, this aspect operates in conjunction with Extension to create various equivalents to Western tense categories. With the DELIMITIVE, the PROSPECTIVE translates the simple future tense of English. When used with the PROXIMAL, the RETROSPECTIVE implies the state/act/event/situation will be occurring in the future and may already be occurring in the present, translatable as ‘will be/do and may already be (doing)’. With NOMIC and ABSTRACT perspectives, it adds a sense of ‘and will always be (doing)’ to the verb. See Sec. 5.7 below for further specific combinations of the RETROSPECTIVE with other Extensions or Aspects.

### 5.6.3 HAB Habitual {#Sec5_6_3}

This aspect conveys the idea of ‘always’ or ‘continues to’. When combined with the RETROSPECTIVE aspect (from Sec. 5.6.1 above), the English ‘used to’ construction offers an equivalent translation, as in *She used to come see me on Wednesdays* . When combined with the PROSPECTIVE aspect (from Sec. 5.6.2 above), the translation becomes ‘will now be (doing)’.

## 5.7 传达类「时态」的信息 {#Sec5_7}

It is natural for speakers of English or other Western languages to expect New Ithkuil morpholoy to provide equivalents to verb “tenses” such as past, present, future, as well as various “perfective” or “imperfective” aspectual forms, in order to denote when/where an act/event/state takes place on a progressive linear timeline in relation to either the contextual “present moment” or in relation to a second, separate act/event/state. Nevertheless, while New Ithkuil has morphology which does more or less convey such tenselike information, such morphology is generally optional and is usually unnecessary, as it is often either inferred by the contextual logic of the situation being described by the sentence, or, more importantly, is often irrelevant to an understanding of the semantic content of the sentence. Unlike Western languages whose grammars require that verbs denote a tense, sentences in New Ithkuil only specify such temporal information if it is genuinely necessary for the proper comprehension of the sentence’s context. If a sentence can convey its communicative point without the need for extraneous specification as to “when” it takes place, then no such temporal information is specified.

As an example, compare the following two similar Ithkuil sentences which differ only in the subtle choice between using CONCLUSIVE aspect versus CULMINATIVE aspect.
Ätrulaöwá dře HakšivéWarswi’a.

CPT‘translative.motion’DYN *[* *default `Ca` ]* CCL OBS 2p+1m/DETABS CONCaTENATED:‘clown’OBJNCORPARENT:*[* *default `Ca` ]* PRC‘planet’LOC

*‘We’ve ended up on the Clown Planet.’*

CPT‘translative.motion’DYN *[* *default `Ca` ]* CUL OBS 2p+1m/DETABS CONCaTENATED:‘clown’OBJNCORPARENT:*[* *default `Ca` ]* PRC‘planet’LOC

*‘We eventually wound up on the Clown Planet.’*

Notice that the translation of the first sentence utilizes the English “present perfect” tense (i.e., “have” + past participle) while the second sentence is translated using simple past tense. Yet the intralinear analysis of both New ithkuil sentences shows that neither one of them specifies any “tense” informtion whatsoever whether past, present, future, or any equivalent to Western “perfective” forms. So why the differing choices of tense when translating these two sentences into English?

In the absense of any morphology specifically denoting a temporal position along a progressive linear timeline, a New Ithkuil sentence is considered to be describing something as manifesting/taking place in the speaker’s (and addressee’s) contextual present moment. So the first sentence is indicating that at the present moment the speaker and addressee find themselves on the Clown Planet. However, the use of CONCLUSIVE aspect indicates that the particular present state of affairs has arisen as the result of events during the short time immediately prior to the present moment. The English present perfect tense is convenient in conveying such a situation where the act/event/state in the present moment is a direct outcome of the immediately preceding shortterm events (where those preceding shortterm events can be considers part of a larger “present”tense context.

In the second sentence, however, use of the CULMINATIVE aspect implies that the present state of affairs is the outcome of a long drawnout process or series of events extending back into the past, so that rather than the preceding events being shortterm and considered part of a larger “present” context, here the present moment is seen as being part of a larger “past” context. Consequently, the semantics of the second New Ithkuil sentence are better translated into English using the past tense.

### 5.7.1 Combinations of Aspect, Extension, and Perspetive {#Sec5_7_1}

Despite the discussion above explaining why conveying “tense”like information in New Ithkuil is both optional and unusual, nevertheless, the language does provide morphology to do so, if necessary. The following Aspect + Extension or Aspect + Aspect combinations constitute formalized/conventionalized indicators of “tense”like information on a verb:

RTR Aspect + DEL Extension = ‘has been / has done’RTR Aspect + PRX Extension = ‘has been (doing) [and may still be (doing)]’RTR Aspect + ICP Extension = ‘began to be’ / ‘began doing’RTR Aspect + ATV Extension = ‘finished being / finished doing’RTR Aspect + GRA Extension = ‘gradually developed into being/doing’RTR Aspect + DPL Extension = ‘gradually stopped being/doing & is/does no longerRTR Aspect + PCS Aspect = ‘just now finished being/doing’RTR + HAB Aspects + DEL Extension = ‘used to be/do but no longer’RTR + HAB Aspects + PRX Extension = ‘used to be/do and may still be (doing)’ PRS Aspect + DEL Extension = simple future tensePRS Aspect + PRX Extension = ‘will be/do & may already be (doing)’PRS Aspect + ICP Extension = ‘will begin to be’ / ‘will start doing’PRS Aspect + ATV Extension = ‘will finish being/doing’PRS Aspect + GRA Extension = ‘will develop into being/doing’PRS Aspect + DPL Extension = ‘will gradually stop being/doing’PRS Aspect + PCS Aspect = ‘just about to be/do’PRS + RTR Aspects = ‘will have’ (e.g., *By then he will have done it* .)PRS + HAB Aspects + DEL Extension = ‘will now be (doing) but not yet’

### 5.7.2 The TPP and RTI Affixes {#Sec5_7_2}

The TPP affix is available to specify a point or span on a pastpresentfuture progressive timeline:

kt TPP Temporal Position Relative to Present

1. in the remote past, once upon a time
2. past/former/previous; once [e.g., I was young once], a long time ago
3. recent; recently
4. . . . just past / just (happened)
5. present/current/present day; now / at present / presently / currently
6. imminent; just about to / about to / on the verge of
7. forthcoming / soon to arrive; soon
8. future / to be / to come / eventual(ly); someday...
9. in the remote future / far in the future / long after we’re gone

Additionally, the RTI affix specifies when an event occurs relative to another event or relative to the contextual “present” of an utterance. This affix may be used on its own or in conjunction with the TPP affix to provide specific tenselike information. (See [Chapter 7](07.htm) on how to construct and use Affixes on a formative.)

lt RTI — Relative Timeline Indicator

1 X is/occurs after the relative/contextual present of a statement (as may be defined by TPP affix) but is considered completed or no longer applicable afterthefact from the speaker’s present viewpoint.

## 5.8 移动 `Cn` 模式 1 语式/格辖词缀至列位 VI `Ca` {#Sec5_8}

If the `Vn``Cn` affix values in Slot VIII shows default MNO Valence ( a ) and a Mood/CaseScope other than FAC or CCN h , then `Vn` may be elided and the `Cn` affix may instead be shown in Slot VI (the `Ca` Slot) under the following circumstance: if `Ca` in Slot VI is default l ( CSLUPXDELMNRM ), then the `Ca` in Slot VI may be replaced by the Mood/CaseScope `Cn` affix, thus shortening the word by one syllable. Note that the `Cn` –Pattern 1 affix FAC/CCN h never moves to Slot VI because it instead elides whenever Slot VIII is zeromarked.

The following example shows the same formative with and without movement of the `Cn` –Pattern 1 affix from Slot VIII to Slot VI:

Äňvyulahlâ.CPT‘apply.varnish’DYN[default `Ca` ]MNOSUBREC*‘Varnish might’ve been applied.’ / ‘It might be varnished.’* Äňvyuhlâ.CPT‘apply.varnish’DYNSUBREC*‘Varnish might’ve been applied.’ / ‘It might be varnished.’*
