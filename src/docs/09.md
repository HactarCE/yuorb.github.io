9.0   REFERENTIALS

Referentials function much like personal pronouns in other languages, although they are more dynamic in their morphology.  There are ten Referentials, each distinguishing three Effects (see [Sec. 5.4](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_05_verbs.htm#Sec5_4) for an explanation of Effect).
9.1  [Single-Referent]() Referential

The structure of a Single-Referent Referential is as follows, where C1 is a consonantal form indicating the particular party being referenced, and V~C1~ is a vocalic affix representing the case of the referent (using the same 68 `Vc` case-affixes from formative Slot IX).  Note that combinations are permissible in Slot 1 (e.g., smlo ‘you (sg.) and (s)he and I’-ERGATIVE) as long as the combination is phonotactically permissible.  The epenthetic - ë - vowel appears before or within C₁ combinations if necessary due to phonotactic rules (e.g., zëmse ‘it and s/he and you(sg.)-ABS’, and may also be suffixed to Slot 4 if necessary for phonotactic purposes.   A second case may be stacked on Referent A by filling in Slot 3 but leaving Slot 4 empty.

For personal referents other than the MONADIC speaker ‘I’, if represented by a single consonant, one may show two separate (i.e., different) instances of that referent in one category by placing one instance of the consonant in Slot 1, and another in Slot 4, e.g., *püwüp* [ma/BEN/DAT - ma/BEN/DAT] ‘to him/her and to (a different) him/her’, *zäwiez* [mi/INS - mi/TRA] ‘with it and for (a different) it’.

The C₁ values themselves and their meaning are shown below:

| Mx | mixed animate/inanimate 3^rd^ party | c         | č        |
| Rdp | Reduplicative (i.e., resumptive)    | th        | ph        |
| Obv | Obviative                           | ll / lç  | rr / rç  |
| PVS | Provisional [see Sec. 9.3 below]    | mm / mç  | nn / nç  |

* the alternate forms of the Obv and PVS categories are used in Referential Affixes (see Sec. 4.6.5 below) to avoid ambiguity with geminated `Ca` forms

To show AGGLOMERATIVE or NOMIC or ABSTRACT categories as a Referential, add the following affixes immediately preceding or following one of the affixes above (as phonotactically permissible):   AGGLOMERATIVE:  - ļ - / - tļ -     NOMIC:  - ç - / - x -     ABSTRACT:  -w / -y
9.2  [Dual-Referent]() Referential

If there are two or more personal referents and each has a different case, this can be shown using a Dual-Referent Referential whose structure is shown below:

| 1                                                                                           | 2                                           | 3                                                                                                                                   | 4                          | 5                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (ë ) C ₁ (( ë ) C₁ (( ë ) C₁ )) |  V~C1~                                           | (w/y + V~C2~                                                                                                                       | (C₂ ( ë ) ) ) | Stress                                                                                                           |
| Referential A                                                                                          | Case of Referential ASame affixes as formative Slot IX | Case of Referential B, or in absence of Referential B,  to add (i.e.,stack) a 2nd Case on to Referential A.  Same affixes as formative Slot IX | Referential B                         | monosyllabic  or penultimate =  defaultultimate =  adjunct carries RPV Essence * |
Examples:  *ëztewim, zëmse, smoyút,  triwejvë*

For personal referents other than the MONADIC speaker ‘I’, if represented by a single consonant, one may show two separate (i.e., different) instances of that referent in one category by placing one instance of the consonant in Slot 1, and another in Slot 4, e.g., *püwüp* [ma/BEN/DAT - ma/BEN/DAT] ‘to him/her and to (a different) him/her’, *zäwiez* [mi/INS - mi/TRA] ‘with it and for (a different) it’.

Note that this dual-referent Referential structure can instead be used to stack a second case onto a single referent by filling in Slot 3 but leaving Slot 4 empty.* Examples:  laiwe, sme’e, ka’u, fo’we’is * (Note that the last three of these examples illustrate that [Sec. 2.2, Rule 3](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_02_morpho-phonology.htm#Sec2_2), applies to Slot 2 V~C1~ and Slot 3 V~C2~ for Cases 37 through 52.)

The tell-tale sign of a Referential (i.e., what distinguishes its phonological structure from a formative) is its ( ë ) C ( C )-V or ( ë ) C ( C )- V - w/y - V -C structure (Formative Slot II has no `Vv` value - ë - nor any Slot IV `Vr` value containing - w - or - y -).
9.3   The Provisional Referential

The PVS Provisional Referential refers to a vague, unspecified, potential, uncertain or unknown party/entity which can be marked for case.  Ostensibly, the closest English translation would be “whatever.”  However, since the identity of the entity is provisional/potential/uncertain, the focus of the personal reference is on the case-relationship being expressed, so that the meaning of the case often determines the proper English translation.  For example, in phrases/sentences using IRG Illocution, the Referential would correspond most closely to an English WH-interrogative pronoun such as PVS-LOC *where?* (“whatever location”), PVS-PUR *why?* (“whatever purpose”), PVS-PRP *‘whose?’* (“whatever owner”), etc.
NOTE: For more information on New Ithkuil equivalents to English WH-interrogatives, see [Sec. 10.6](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_10_spec_constructions.htm#Sec10_6).
9.4  Impersonal and Abstract Reference

To express impersonal referential categories such as “one”, “someone”, “something”, “a thing”, “things”, etc., add the NOMIC affix above to the ma or mi referential affixes above, depending on the intended meaning.  Applying the ABSTRACT affix to a tangible Referential form gives a word meaning *“all that X is”* or *“everything about X”* as in *“all about me”, “everything having to do with you”* or *“everything about it”. * When appled to the Mx Referential, the ABSTRACT affix gives the meaning *“everything and everyone”* or *“all that there is.”*
9.5   [Combination]() Referential with Case-Stacking

A third Referential structure exists called a Combination Referential.  It is used to add Case, Specification, `VxCs` affix information or a second case (case-stacking) to one of the Referential forms.  The tell-tale signs of this adjunct are the Slot 4 consonant-forms containing - x -, - xt -, - xp -, or - xx - in what looks like the `Ca` slot of a formative (these four consonant conjuncts are not possible `Ca` forms).  Examples:   *slex,  poxtanz* ,   *ëtkexpa,  ëlsuoxxéd* .

| 1                                                                       | 2                    | 3                                                             | ### 4                                    | ### 5                                                               | 6                                                                       |

9.6   [Applying Carrier](), Quotative, Naming, and Phrasal Adjunct Forms to Referentials

In addition to the Referential affixes shown in [Sec. 9.1](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_09_referentials.htm#Sec9_1_1), the C₁ slot of the Combination Referential above as well as the C₁ slot of the the Single- or Dual-Referent Referential in [Sec. 9.2](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_09_referentials.htm#Sec9_2) may also take any of the `Cp` Suppletive Adjunct affixes ( hl -,  hm -,  hn -, - hň -), thus allowing these adjuncts the same scope and flexibility as Referentials in terms of showing Specification, `VxCs` affixes, and case-stacking for a following proper noun, foreign word/phrase, or quote.
NOTE: When using a `Cp` Suppletive Adjunct form in Slot 1 of a Referential it is necessary to prefix the `Cp` form by an epenthetic vowel, as follows:

·         If using a `Cp` Suppletive Adjunct form in Slot 1 of a Combination Referential from [Sec. 9.5](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_09_referentials.htm#Sec9_5) above, the `Cp` value must be preceded by  a - to avoid the adjunct being mistaken for a Concatenated Formative.

·         If using a `Cp` Suppletive Adjunct form in Slot 1 of a Single- or Dual-Referential from [Sec. 9.1](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_09_referentials.htm#Sec9_1_1) and [Sec. 9.2](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_09_referentials.htm#Sec9_2) above, the `Cp` value must be preceded by the word-initial diphthong   üo -  to avoid the adjunct being mistaken for a Modular Adjunct.
