This is similar to a case-frame, except that where case-frames function solely as an equivalent to subordinate clauses in Western languages, this adjunct causes the subsequent phrase to become a conventionalized, (quasi-)lexicalized gestalt. It thus serves as an equivalent to English phrasal gestalts (often hyphenated), as in the following examples:</p><p><em>Hey, shit-for-brains!

Unlike other adjuncts which function as substitutions for the morphological Slots within formatives, Bias adjuncts function independently from formatives and have semantic scope over the entire sentence (again, much like Interjections in natural languages).</p><p>Another unique quality of Bias adjuncts is that they violate the standard phonotactic rules of the language (again like the supera-segmental interjections of natural languages) by being purely consonantal in their phonetic make-up. They should be pronounced with a preceding and following pause. Each Bias adjunct has the same consonant-form as an associated lexico-semantic root phonologically structured to contain continuant and sonorant consonants so that when used as autonomous adjuncts, they may be pronounced in an exaggerated, prolonged fashion. Additionally, those ending in a voiceless stop or voiceless affricate may aspirate or even ejectivize the consonant. The Bias Adjuncts are listed below along with their meanings.</p><table><thead><tr><th>ACC</th><th>ACCIDENTAL</th><th>lf</th><th><em>‘As luck would have it...’ ‘Fate has decided that...’</em> <em>‘What luck!’</em></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ACH</td><td>ARCHETYPAL</td><td>mçt</td><td><em>what (a) ...!; how . . .! ; Boy!
