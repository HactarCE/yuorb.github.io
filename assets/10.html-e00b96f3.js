Most of these specialized constructions constitute alternative or “short-cut” means of expressing more long-winded “standard” constructions, although some represent standard expressions in and of themselves.</p><p><a href="">10.1 Concatenation</a> and Format</p><p>Many languages, including English, are able to combine two separate meanings into a single verb, a process termed conflation . This is illustrated in the following English sentences:</p><ol><li>*He bicycled south. = *He traveled south by bicycle.</li><li><em>She dolled herself up</em> . = She made herself look as pretty as a doll.</li><li><em>They’re shelving the books</em> . = They’re putting the books on the shelf/shelves.</li><li><em>Slide me a beer</em> . = Give me a beer by sliding it (e.g., along the bar).</li></ol><p>The above sentences show four verbs which respectively carry inherent senses of vector movement, transformation, positioning/placement, and giving. The patterning of such “conflated” verbs is usually random and haphazard in any given language. For example, the English <em>to bicycle</em> in sentence (1) means ‘to travel by means of bicycle,’ not ‘to make a bicycle’ or ‘to be a bicycle.’ On the other hand, the verb <em>to doll up</em> does not mean to ‘travel by doll,’ but rather ‘to make appear like a doll.’ Yet, <em>to shelve</em> means ‘to place on a shelf,’ not ‘to travel by means of shelves’ or ‘to make appear like a shelf.’ And none of the verbs in the first three sentences connotes the idea of giving or conveyance as does <em>slide</em> in sentence (4).</p><p>As can be seen, verb conflation is essentially a “short-cut” way of combining an unspoken primary verbal sense (such as movement, transformation, placement, giving, etc.) with an overtly expressed verb that conveys a secondary sense such as means, manner, or location. This can be formally notated for our four sentences above as follows:</p><p>He [1: (TRAVEL+past tense) south] [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) bicycle] = He bicycled south* .</p><p>She [1: (CAUSE-TO-RESEMBLE+past tense+reflexive)] [2: (IN-THE-MANNER-OF) doll] = She dolled herself up* .</p><p>They [1: (PUT+progressive) the books] [2: (TO-LOCATION-OF) shelves] = They’re shelving the books* .</p><p>[1: (GIVE+imperative)] a beer [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) sliding] to me = Slide me a beer* .</p><p>Note that the particular unspoken covert and overt senses (shown by the numerals 1 and 2 in the above analyses) are specific to any given verb and must be subjectively learned by the listener, i.e., a speaker of English must learn that <em>to hand</em> means to GIVE by MEANS of one’s hand, but <em>to shoulder</em> does not mean to GIVE by MEANS of one’s shoulder.</p><p>Thus, while conflation of verbs presents a potential opportunity for instantiating verbs with patterns of overt and covert meaning, the lack of systemization prevents one from knowing with certainty what pattern to use when attempting to interpret the usage of a verb form.</p><p>New Ithkuil systemizes verb conflation into a productive scheme, in which any formative can be concatenated directly with another formative (termed the parent formative). The operational sense of the concatenated formative and its semantic relation to the parent formative is conveyed by its case-affix in Slot IX. The concatenated formative is placed immediately preceding the parent formative, and is structured as a regular formative, able to take any and all morphology as appropriate and semantically permissible for the concatenated pair as a whole. The concatenated formative also shows one of the following eight <code>Cc</code> values in Slot I to indicate that it and the following formative constitute a concatenated pair. The meaning of the different <code>Cc</code> values is explained below the table.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Slot IX = <code>Vf</code></th><th>plus w-form of <code>Ca</code> shortcut*</th><th>plus y-form of <code>Ca</code> shortcut*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Type-1 Concatenation</td><td>h</td><td>hl</td><td>hm</td></tr><tr><td>Type-2 Concatenation</td><td>hw</td><td>hr</td><td>hn</td></tr></tbody></table><pre><code>* See Sec. 3.10 for an explanation of thew - and  y -  `Ca` shortcuts\n</code></pre>',16),c=t("code",null,"Vf",-1),f=t("code",null,"Vc",-1),m=t("code",null,"Vf",-1),p=t("code",null,"Vc",-1),u=t("em",null,"with the immediately-following parent formative",-1),I=t("code",null,"Vc",-1),T=t("code",null,"Vk",-1),N=t("br",null,null,-1),b=t("code",null,"Vf",-1),E=t("code",null,"Vf",-1),g=t("code",null,"Vf",-1),A={href:"http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_11_syntax.htm#Sec11_8",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},O=t("br",null,null,-1),v=t("p",null,[e("As seen in the above table, there are two types of concatenation.

Therefore, one should not attach the usual NOMIC affix - ç - / - x - or the ABSTRACT affix -w / -y to the Referential affix itself (as when using a Referential); instead, show NOMIC or ABSTRACT personal-reference forms using the appropriate <code>Ca</code> Perspective value in Slot VI of the formative.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Specifications and Verbal Meaning: Because they are full roots, these Specialized Personal-Reference root require that a meaning be assigned to the four Specifications, as well as meanings assigned to verbal forms.

One method is to not ask a question at all, but rather to use a verb such as ‘state’ or ‘say/tell’ in DIRECTIVE Illocution to express a command that the addressee provide the information being sought, i.e, *‘Tell me your name’ *as opposed to <em>‘What is your name?’</em> Another equivalent to WH-questions is to use the PVS Referential in conjunction with the IVL₁/4 affix -inļ indicating INTERROGATIVE Illocution so that the PVS Referential functions much like an English interrogative pronoun. Examples:<br> Mmiexinļ *‘Why? * [i.e., For what purpose?]’</p><p>Mma’oxinļ ‘When?’*<br> Nnioxinļ <em>‘To/for whose benefit? / To the benefit of what?’</em> ,<br> Ňňeöxinļ ‘Resulting (detrimentally) in what? / With what undesirable result?’*<br> Mmauxinļ* ‘Whose? / Belonging to what?’*</p><p>Finally, one can form the equivalent of WH-questions using INTERROGATIVE Illocution in conjunction with a formative affixed with Degrees 1, 2, 3, 8 or 9 of the PTN affix shown below. When used this way, the formative carrying the PTN affix must be marked as the semantic focus of the sentence (i.e., it must either immediately precede the verb in terms of word-order or it must carry the TPF/9 affix).<br> PTN Affix</p><table><thead><tr><th>-sv</th><th>PTN Potential</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>whatever X is / whatever X may be</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>whatever X was or may have been (but is no more)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>whatever X will be or may become (but is not yet)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>...or something like/similar to X in function, purpose, or consequence</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>...or something like/similar to X in appearance/description</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>and whatever else X may be(come)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>and whatever else X entails or carries with it as a consequence</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>which(ever) X (it is or may be) [i.e., of a known/limited number of possible identifications available to assign to X, the one identification that actually is (chosen as) X]</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>what(ever) X (it is or may be) [i.e., of an unknown number of possible identifications one might/could assign to X, the one identification that actually is (chosen as) X]</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Examples:<br> Weilüsve erčuléi kšilo?* <em>‘Which of the children did the clown corrupt?’</em></p><p>Laluţkusvu utxoléi akftyäloë? <em>‘What kind of person drinks ammonia?</em><br> 10.7 *Using Case on UNFRAMED Verbal Formatives</p>',23),$={href:"http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_07_affixes.htm#Sec7_6",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ee=a("<p>DEPENDENT case: Abẓe willyothoilyá utplaliör . <em>‘My self-esteem is dependent upon (my) singing this song well.’</em></p><p>POSTCURSIVE case: A hrelu-azčojhaillöelyá . <em>‘It was after the child pulled a tantrum.’</em></p><p>Intralinear analysis: RTR Type2.concatenated.root:‘person’-Stem2-IND - parent.root:Stem1-‘self-centered.behavior’-DYN/CSV-CRL₂/1-default.<code>Ca</code> -PCR-ASR/OBS</p><p>TRANSFORMATIVE case: Kšölaölwáu wele . <em>‘The child is hereby transformed into a clown!’</em> (more literally: *‘It is transformation into a clown that is declared to happen to the child!’ * )<br> 10.8 Equivalent to English “Strings” of Adverbial Locative Particles</p><p>English has the seemingly unique ability to create succinct “moving images” of complex trajectories, paths, treks, and in-situ movements by simple juxtaposition of locative/directional particles (i.e., prepositions acting mostly as adverbial particles). For example , imagine the manager of a basement nightclub talking to a friend on the sidewalk outside his club. He invites the friend to the balcony outside the back of the club, which one gets to by descending into the club, going past the dance floor, up a flight of stairs, then along a hallway to the back door. He does so by saying the following sentence to his friend, containing a string of nine prepositions (the first eight of which are functioning as adverbial particles):</p><p><em>‘Come on down inside, up along through out back to the balcony.’</em></p><p>New Ithkuil allows a speaker to create similar succinct “moving images”. Each motion root (whether referring to in-situ or translative motion) has a corresponding -<code>VxCs</code> affix of the same form (e.g., for the root - KR - ‘OBLIQUE LINEAR MOTION’, there is a corresponding suffix - kr ). Each of these affixes has the following nine degrees:</p><table><thead><tr><th>1</th><th>Motion through X. Specifically, interior perlative motion/movement in a manner described by the suffix’s corresponding root among/within an external/surrounding/underlying (quasi-)static medium.
