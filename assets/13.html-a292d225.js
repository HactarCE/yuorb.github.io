The final unit is 100 <sup>8</sup> , that is, 10 quadrillion or 100 million hundred-millions, the last number for which the language assigns a separate root and symbol. After ten quadrillion, numbers are referred to as multiples of lower sets, similar to saying in English “one trillion quadrillion” instead of the equivalent “one octillion.”</p><p>While the above system may seem awkward, it actually parallels Western base-ten numerals in terms of its systematization. For example, in a Western number like 456,321,777,123, each set of three numbers between the commas tells how many hundreds there are of a certain power of 1000 (i.e., there are 123 of 1000 <sup>0</sup> , 777 of 1000 <sup>1</sup> , 321 of 1000 <sup>2</sup> , and 456 of 1000 <sup>3</sup> , or in more common terms 123 ones, 777 thousands, 321 millions, 456 billions). The same exact system holds for New Ithkuil, except that the sets of numbers “between the commas” so to speak, is the number of ten-thousands, not thousands. Thus, if we were to rewrite the Western number 456,321,777,123 in such a system, it would be 4563,2177,7123 (i.e., 7123 of 10000 <sup>0</sup> , 2177 of 10000 <sup>1</sup> , and 4563 of 10000 <sup>2</sup> , that being 7123 ones, 2177 ten-thousands, and 4563 hundred-millions).<br> 13.2 Semantic Designations for Numerical Stems</p><p>The semantic roots for numbers in Ithkuil from 1 to 99 are based on roots for 1 through 10, to which the nine degrees of the TNX affix -rs are added. Each of the nine degrees of this suffix, when applied to one of the ten number-roots, corresponds to an additional multiple of ten.</p><table><thead><tr><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th><th>100</th><th>100<sup>2</sup></th><th>100<sup>4</sup></th><th>100<sup>8</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>-VR -</td><td>-LL -</td><td>-KS -</td><td>-Z -</td><td>-PŠ -</td><td>-ST -</td><td>-CP -</td><td>-NS -</td><td>-ČK -</td><td>-LẒ -</td><td>-J -</td><td>-GZ -</td><td>-PC -</td><td>-KẒ -</td><td>-ČG -</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following six number roots are used when needed to designate numbers beyond ten when needed for counting and mathematical operations involving non-decimal number bases up to base-16.

Diacritic marks then indicate the number of thousands (up to 9000) to b added. Consequently, written numbers from zero to 9999 are a single (composite) character. Numbers from 10,000 to 104 are similarly represented by a second number placed in front of the core “thousands” number.</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_13_numbers_files/image002.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Extensions to the bottom-left indicate the number of tens:</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_13_numbers_files/image003.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Extensions to the top-right of the above symbols indicate the number of hundreds:</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_13_numbers_files/image004.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Diacritics placed inside the top-left quarter of the 1-through-10 symbols indicate the number of thousands up to 9000:</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_13_numbers_files/image005.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Examples:</p><pre><code>![](http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_13_numbers_files/image007.jpg)
</code></pre><p>13.4 Using Numbers In Speech</p><p>Spoken numbers are formed from the above stems using both the PARTITIVE and COMITATIVE cases, as well as using the coordinative affix -V<em>ň/1</em> (= -i ň ). The number of largest base units is shown by placing the base-unit term in the PARTITIVE. If this is then followed by another collection of smaller base units, that number of smaller base units is connected using the COMITATIVE case while the smaller base-unit term is again in the PARTITIVE. Single units (from 1 to 99) are connected by the coordinative affix when they are part of the number of hundreds or higher base-units.</p><p>It should be noted that when pronouncing numbers greater than 199, it is normal to omit the word gzalui (= the PARTITIVE of gzal * ‘one hundred’) referring to the number of hundreds as long as this does not lead to ambiguity or a lack of clarity. This is equivalent to the custom in colloquial English of saying ‘three twelve’ for ‘three hundred (and) twelve.’ Examples:<br> ksalirsa (gzalui) walẓärs*<br> literally: “42 (of hundreds) 29”<em>4229</em><br> cpalärsa wapcui wansorsë’i (gzalui) cpalörs*<br> literally: “26 of ten-thousands with 97 (of hundreds) 66” = 26,9766<em>269,766</em><br> wallärsa gzalui wapcui*<br> literally: “21 of hundred of ten-thousands”<em>21,000,000</em><br> [NOTE: gzalui is required in this example]<br> ksalorsa gzalui walẓorsiň wakẓui za’lëi gzalui zalëirsiň wapcui pša’lersëi vralörs<br> literally:<br> “72 of hundreds and 79 of hundred-millions with 3 of hundreds and 53 of ten-thousands with 3460”<em>727,903,533,460</em><br> 13.5 Dates and Times of Day</p><p>The SPT Affix is used in expressing the hour of day, day of the week, week of the month, month of the year, the year and the century. It is used with the number roots (usually Stem 3) to render, e.g., ‘the eighth hour of the day’, ‘the third day of the week (i.e., Wednesday)’ or ‘20th of May’, etc. Furthermore, each use of this affix can in turn be modified by a following Type-3 number affix (e.g., XX2, XX3, etc.) to enumerate the higher-ordered time-period named by the affix. For example, for the word <em>wuksärsëirwa</em> ‘22nd day of the month’, the SPT/5 affix - <em>ëirw</em> - can in turn be modified by a following Type-3 number affix, e.g., <em>wuksärsëirwiasta</em> ‘22nd of May’.

Beginning with the number 101, numbers are referred to by the number of hundreds plus the number of units, just as a decimal system, beginning with the number 11, refers to the number of tens plus the number of units. However, where a decimal system then shifts to a unit referring to 100 once “10 tens” is reached, a centesimal system proceeds to the number 10,000 before establishing a new unit reference (i.e., “100 hundreds”). Thus the number 3254, which in a decimal system is 3 thousands — 2 hundreds — 5 tens — 4 ones, in a centesimal system becomes 32 hundreds—54 ones, and would be only two digits when written (the single character representing 32, and the single character representing 54).
