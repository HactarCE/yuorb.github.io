These categories are shown by the vocalic <code>Vk</code> affix in Slot IX. Note that in Chapter 4 above, we’ve already seen that Slot IX is used for the <code>Vc</code> case affix for nouns. The <code>Vk</code> affix for verbs uses the same vowel-forms as affixes as the <code>Vc</code> case affix — the distinction as to whether an affix in Slot IX is <code>Vc</code> or <code>Vk</code> is determined by the syllabic stress of the word. If the word has ultimate stress (i.e., stress on the final syllable), the Slot IX value is <code>Vk</code> ; otherwise, it is a <code>Vc</code> case marker. Sec. 6.1 below explains the categories of Illocution and Validation, while Sec. 6.1.3 below provides the Slot IX <code>Vk</code> affix values denoting these categories.<br> 6.1 Illocution and Validation<br> 6.1.1 Illocution: Illocution refers to the type of “speech act” being made by a speaker, i.e., the purpose of the statement in terms of how the addressee is to interpret either its truth-value, or its requirements/demands upon the speaker in terms of a physical and/or psychological response. There are nine illocutions. Additionally, the first Illocution, ASSERTIVE, has eight sub-types relating to the evidentiary basis for the assertion (analyzed in Sec. 6.1.2 below under Validation).</p><table><thead><tr><th>ILLOCUTION</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ASR</td><td>ASSERTIVE</td></tr><tr><td>DIR</td><td>DIRECTIVE</td></tr><tr><td>DEC</td><td>DECLARATIVE</td></tr><tr><td>IRG</td><td>INTERROGATIVE</td></tr><tr><td>VER</td><td>VERIFICATIVE</td></tr><tr><td>ADM</td><td>ADMONITIVE</td></tr><tr><td>POT</td><td>POTENTIATIVE</td></tr><tr><td>HOR</td><td>HORTATIVE</td></tr><tr><td>CNJ</td><td>CONJECTURAL</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="">6.1.2 Validation</a>: Validation refers to the evidential basis for a statement in ASSERTIVE illocution. Like various Native American and other natural languages, New Ithkuil requires a speaker to grammatically indicate the evidential source for an any assertion. Note that Validation applies only to formatives with ASSERTIVE illocution; it does not apply to the other eight illocutions, as they are not making a truth claim about the world. There are nine Validations: OBSERVATIONAL , RECOLLECTIVE , PURPORTIVE , REPORTIVE , UNSPECIFIED , IMAGINARY , CONVENTIONAL , INTUITIVE , and INFERENTIAL , explained below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>VALIDATION</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>#####OBS</td><td>OBSERVATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td>#####REC</td><td>RECOLLECTIVE</td></tr><tr><td>#####PUP</td><td>PURPORTIVE</td></tr><tr><td>#####RPR</td><td>REPORTIVE</td></tr><tr><td>#####USP</td><td>UNSPECIFIED</td></tr><tr><td>#####IMA</td><td>IMAGINARY</td></tr><tr><td>#####CVN</td><td>CONVENTIONAL</td></tr><tr><td>#####ITU</td><td>INTUITIVE</td></tr><tr><td>#####INF</td><td>INFERENTIAL</td></tr><tr><td>6.1.3 Slot IX <code>Vk</code> Affix Values Denoting Illocution and Validation</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Illocution</th><th>Validation</th><th>Meaning of Validation</th><th><code>Vk</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ASR``ASSERTIVE Illocution</td><td>#####OBS</td><td>OBSERVATIONAL</td><td>present sensory knowledge or present sensory experience: “I perceive... / I know...”</td></tr><tr><td>#####REC</td><td>RECOLLECTIVE</td><td>past sensory knowledge or past sensory experience – “I remember... / I know (from memory)...”</td><td>â</td></tr><tr><td>#####PUP</td><td>PURPORTIVE</td><td>knowledge from a definitive/(quasi-)verifiable 3rd party source: “I’ve read... / (an expert) has said...”</td><td>é</td></tr><tr><td>#####RPR</td><td>REPORTIVE</td><td>knowledge from a 3rd party: “I heard (from someone)... / someone has said...”</td><td>í</td></tr><tr><td>#####USP</td><td>UNSPECIFIED</td><td>[Validation deliberately unspecified]</td><td>êi</td></tr><tr><td>#####IMA</td><td>IMAGINARY</td><td>unreal statement, not intended as true, based on whim, imagination, dream, altered mental state, etc.</td><td>ô</td></tr><tr><td>#####CVN</td><td>CONVENTIONAL</td><td>cultural/conventional (i.e., collectively agreed-upon) knowledge: “They say... / It is said...”</td><td>ó</td></tr><tr><td>#####ITU</td><td>INTUITIVE</td><td>intuition, hunch, subjective feeling, past experiences, etc. – “I feel... / I have a hunch... / something tells me...”</td><td>û</td></tr><tr><td>#####INF</td><td>INFERENTIAL</td><td>inference from evidence (or absence of alternatives), induction, extrapolation, etc. “I infer... / I reason...”</td><td>ú</td></tr><tr><td>DIR</td><td>DIRECTIVE Illocution</td><td>the statement is either an imperative command to another party to do/be something, or a “commissive” statement committing the speaker to a specific state or course of action (i.e., a vow, promise, guarantee, etc.)</td><td>ái</td></tr><tr><td>DEC</td><td>DECLARATIVE Illocution</td><td>a “performative” statement which. by its utterance/publication, creates a change of state (at least psychologically) for the addressees (i.e., a declaration, announcement, edict, etc.)</td><td>áu</td></tr><tr><td>IRG</td><td>INTERROGATIVE Illocution</td><td>a statement whose purpose is to inquire or seek information from the addressee (i.e., equivalent to an English WH-question) -- see<a href="10#Sec10_6">Sec. 10.6</a> for further explanation on the use of IRG Illocution</td><td>éi</td></tr><tr><td>VER</td><td>VERIFICATIVE Illocution</td><td>a statement whose purpose is to seek/obtain corroboration, confirmation, or verification (i.e., equivalent to a Yes/No question)</td><td>éu</td></tr><tr><td>ADM</td><td>ADMONITIVE Illocution</td><td>a statement whose purpose is to provide advisory/admonitive information to the addressee (i.e., a warning)</td><td>óu</td></tr><tr><td>POT</td><td>POTENTIATIVE Illocution</td><td>a statement of wishing, hoping, or other unreal(ized) provenance</td><td>ói</td></tr><tr><td>HOR</td><td>HORTATIVE Illocution</td><td>a counterfactual statement indicating a desired but impossible state of affairs that cannot be realized (equivalent to English hortative constructions such as<em>If only..., Were that..., If only it were so that...</em></td><td>íu</td></tr><tr><td>CNJ</td><td>CONJECTURAL Illocution</td><td>Equivalent to an English-language “if”-clause, indicating that the statement is offered as a conjectured hypothetical, ostensibly to be followed by a “then...” implicational clause.

In Western languages, the embedded sentence becomes either a subordinate clause or a relative clause, explicitly introduced by a conjunctions such as ‘that,’ ‘which,’ ‘who,’ ‘where,’‘although,’‘if,’‘while,’‘whereas,’ or a preposition followed by a conjunction, such as ‘through which,’‘by whom,’etc. In English, such clauses can also occur as an infinitive or gerundial verb construction. Both relative and subordinate clauses are illustrated in the following sentences:</p><p><em>The dog <em>that ate my hat</em> belongs to them.</em></p><p><em>I want * him to stop shouting.</em></p><p><em>The committee voted * to fire the superintendant.</em></p><p><em>We demand * (that) you give us equal pay.</em></p><p>Although he’s a college graduate, he acts like a child.*</p><p><em>This is the slot</em> through which the letter is passed.*</p><p>In case you’re unaware, I’ll be leaving next month.*</p><p><em>The boy <em>walking toward us</em> is my nephew.</em></p><p>The New Ithkuil equivalent to relative or subordinate clauses is known as a case-frame , or simply, frame . Conceptually, the sentence to be embedded is simply treated as a noun participant to the main verb of a sentence and is therefore marked for case like any other noun. For example, take the following two sentences:</p><p><em>She and I were working together.</em></p><p><em>The two nations were at war.</em></p><p>Suppose we want to use the second sentence to provide a temporal context for the first sentence. In English we could do this by subordinating the second sentence to the first using the conjunction ‘while,’ as in <em>She and I were working together while the two nations were at war</em> . Alternately, we could create a relative clause by inserting a connecting prepositional phrase, as in <em>She and I were working together during the time (that) the two nations were at war</em> .</p><p>In New Ithkuil, temporal context for a sentence may be provided by a noun in any of the temporal cases such as the CONCURSIVE (see Sec. 4.9.1). A word such as ‘summer’ or ‘famine’ would be placed in the CONCURSIVE case to create a sentence corresponding to:</p><p><em>She and I were working together during the summer.</em></p><p><em>She and I were working together at the time of the famine.</em></p><p>Just as the single words ‘summer’ and ‘famine’ are placed in the CONCURSIVE case, so an entire sentence such as <em>The two nations were at war</em> can be placed in the CONCURSIVE case to provide the temporal context for the main sentence. In other words, New Ithkuil treats the entire subordinate sentence as a noun phrase to be declined into any required case. That is the purpose of a frame, to place sentences into noun cases. By doing so, New Ithkuil accomplishes the same task for which Western languages use relative and subordinate conjunctions.</p><h3 id="_6-2-1-relation-and-the-placement-of-frames" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-2-1-relation-and-the-placement-of-frames" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <a href="">6.2.1 Relation and the Placement of Frames</a></h3><p>To construct a case-frame, the second-order sentence (i.e., the sentence to be subordinated) is placed in the main sentence at the point where a noun declined for the required case would appear. The actual case of the second-order sentence is indicated in the verbal formative the same way as for nominal formatives, i.e., via the Vc affix in Slot IX. Additionally, the syllabic stress of the formative will change to show FRAMED* Relation , explained in the next paragraph.<br> Relation is a binary category having two values UNFRAMED and FRAMED referring to whether the formative is or is not in a Case-Frame. The main verbal formative of a sentence is in UNFRAMED Relation (i.e., not in a case-frame), marked by ultimate (final) stress, which also indicates that the formative’s Slot IX affix is the <code>Vk</code> affix showing Illocution, Expectation, and Validation. Once a verbal formative is subordinated within a case-frame, it takes FRAMED relation, shown by antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllabic stress, in which case the formative’s Slot IX affix is the <code>Vc</code> affix showing the case of the Case-Frame. Finally, if the formative has penultimate (second-from-last) syllabic stress then the formative is a noun in UNFRAMED Relation and the Slot IX affix is the <code>Vc</code> affix showing Case.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Penultimate Stress = UNFRAMED Relation + <code>Vc</code></th><th>Ultimate Stress = UNFRAMED Relation + <code>Vk</code></th><th>Antepenultimate Stress = FRAMED Relation + <code>Vc</code></th></tr></thead></table><p>If the formative does not have sufficient syllables to take antepenultimate stress, add syllables by filling Slots II and/or Slots VIII and IX with their default values. Note that a monosyllabic formative (other than a concatenated formative — see Chapter 8) is considered morphologically to have ultimate stress (i.e., it is an UNFRAMED verbal formative).</p>',63),h={href:"http://www.ithkuil.net/newithkuil_affixes.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=i(`<p>In general, the perspective of the verb in the secondary sentence operates independently from that of the main verb, however, it is also common for the perspective of the verb in the secondary sentence to be placed in the ABSTRACT, which has the effect of deferring all Perspective information about the verb to the main verb, similarly to the way English subordinate clauses using gerunds and infinitives defer all tense information to the main verb of the sentence.</p><h3 id="_6-2-2-example-of-case-frames-in-use" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-2-2-example-of-case-frames-in-use" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6.2.2 Example of Case-Frames in Use</h3><p>Étkwö’e wairţtuzwu welhwëubzanëi itrulalžói ka’i wurmieli’o wuttíhia kšiluržu.</p><p><em>STEM2/PRC</em> /FRAMED -‘attend.scheduled.event’* -PCR* [default <code>Ca</code> ]-G-‘study’-ACCESSOR:IND₂-IND* <em>[</em> <em>default <code>Ca</code> ]-STEM2/PRC-‘play.musical.instrument’-</em> FEA₂/5- TPF₁/1 -STM <em>STEM2/CPT</em> <em>-‘approach’</em> -OBG₁/1*-POT <em>pa/BEN-ACT [default <code>Ca</code> ]-STEM3/PRC-‘house’-1m/NEU-PRP-ALL [default <code>Ca</code> ]-STEM3/PRC</em> /FRAMED -‘introduce’-RCP-APL ‘clown’* -OBJ-<em>[default <code>Ca</code> ]-HRC₁/9-IND</em></p><p><em>‘After the students attend the concert, they must come to my house to meet the Chief Clown.’</em></p><h3 id="_6-3-relative-clause-formation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-3-relative-clause-formation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 6.3 Relative Clause Formation</h3><p>Generally, New Ithkuil uses the RELATIVE case and the DESCRIPTIVE case to form relative clauses.
