Register Initial Adjunct and Register Final Adjunct encapsulate the governed content. A Register clause frequently imparts semantic insights to an adjoining verb or noun; however, it should not be assumed that these words hold scope over the Register clause. Given that a Register clause functions as a parenthetical and self-contained sentence, its removal does not disrupt the overall message conveyed by the original sentence. These clauses have the flexibility to be situated at any point within a sentence, and may even function as standalone sentences. A typical illustration of this is the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register, which, being the default Register, is frequently disregarded; thus, it is prudent to presume that any sentence, including sentences enclosed by Non-<abbr>NNR</abbr>, is <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked. It is advisable to consider every sentence as being governed by the Register, typically the <abbr>NNR</abbr>. As <abbr>NNR</abbr> is signified by the zero marker, a <abbr>NNR</abbr> clause is inherently autonomous, not subject to subordination by other Register clauses, yet capable of exerting influence over each one individually.</p><p>A Sentence-Initial Bias governs the entirety of the sentence, rather than the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register. Bias(es) can form a sentence, but should still be <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)rral.</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)“cat”-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A simple sentence</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)hi</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)SPF</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>...</dt><dd>...</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hiu.</dt><dd>SPF_END</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of single Register clause</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)lf</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)ACC</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>lst.</dt><dd>ANP</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of Biases</div></div><p>Simple Sentence</p>',5),u=m("p",null,"The parts of speech and Coordinative Affix",-1);function v(y,f){const t=n("Mermaid"),d=n("Tabs");return c(),h("div",null,[p,e(d,{id:"39",data:[{id:"Phrase"},{id:"Frame"}]},{title0:a(({value:s,isActive:i})=>[r("Phrase")]),title1:a(({value:s,isActive:i})=>[r("Frame")]),tab0:a(({value:s,isActive:i})=>[e(t,{id:"mermaid-41",code:"eJydkt9PgzAQx9/9Ky57MEoCUng3mUQeCWZmL8RkR6mjyq8UNmPCH28ZReiYTncvTe/6vbvPXV+z8oOmKBp4frgCafUu3gqsUqjsaBGmAmsG9uLlEOss4YLRhpfFIOissjHyuagb8LzwzvPWZo7inSXglyLHhu/ZmKCy42jFi23GTkfpr9Eksixr6kDTvG9V1Vbm1q9UvyYHISv6c0R1IkXqTFI7GC02nrccWIIy5wVmY19wkzJMbjeT6VROLEWG8bhn4lMqfLgGX6wNA3gBTcqgxpwBzXBXM11HpW6ZvCFlRTMtEdpHBRRw0Mpac7cidahGOlWRI3YysJNzSyb9QIJ/DYR0A/kLGNEJSA8335X7/S3ds9/S7TtejR37p3p0L1yaK5f2A5r2TJE9tbLS3K2A3XFlX0NB/eY="})]),tab1:a(({value:s,isActive:i})=>[e(t,{id:"mermaid-44",code:"eJyN0s9LwzAUB/C7f8Wjx0Dpr5sHoRbmTecq8zCEZfZlCaZpSVNF6B9v2tit6xhbIJe85Pt5D8Jk9fPJqTbw9ngHdjG28baLSpfUiG8MllzTBoOFpiUGK2SoURlBJVStaUSBYDgC66tb78MFCBtASC7UXiIckggZqi8rICRVv+CC56eDMz+csPNS3ta1xD7/NPBdGC7UeXNNu9trWnNg0cYbMIj+S0PvEbXNZ9mzX1L9hQWsUe/ssIcpxhxUhRs28v2Hzj4Ismxp97pjbAbFIxRPodhB6c1QfBVKRiiZQomD8puhxEGvl6FwhMJ7eEKFmsqpGPbiJcb9kFMxpMfZUrvzzt74AwHhv5A="})]),_:1}),g,e(t,{id:"mermaid-60",code:"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"}),u,e(t,{id:"mermaid-64",code:"eJx9TzGOwjAQ7P2K/YCR7soraJCu4i4SSDQWhe0sxFJso/UGavJUXoITghJExHQez8zOSCkFO67xB/6jd0HXi99IXrM74629zpGtXBWF6IziUMeLrTQxrDcCMlJjjqRPFdikVjFSmc3sYoAtU2O5Idz3Oigdoe1/NusHM3UfvtRwGKZtBm+GVltGDzqUUHCFBH+RThV6TC8yDOVM+PdceDu6xm7Dqg5G5dWjxn4oMIkyUi7tWx0DciGXeWX/erJntUMy01bgAuRwSNoj2Fo3CfddYBJ34XWIbQ=="})])}const C=l(b,[["render",v],["__file","scoping.html.vue"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/docs/scoping.html","title":"Scoping in New Ithkuil","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Scoping in New Ithkuil","description":"Syntactic Terminology Nominal vs Verbal The Unframed Verbal Formative (abbr.
