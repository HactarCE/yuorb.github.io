For the purposes of grammatical notation, the degree of an affix is shown as a subscript to the vocalic V-marker of an affix (i.e., it replaces the subscript-x in the notation <code>VxCs</code> , e.g., - V₂g/7 ).</p><p>Use of the Type-1 version of a suffix caries a mere circumstantial meaning applicable to the context at hand in a subjectively incidental, happenstance, temporary, or informal manner, whereas the Type-2 version of a suffix implies a derivational meaning which can entail lexical differences when translating into English.</p><p>For example, the Type-1 suffix - urx , i.e., -V₁ rx/9 , and its Type-2 counterpart -uirx , i.e., -V₂ rx/9 , which both mean ‘exactly similar to…/indistinguishable from/identical…,’ the difference in usage being that the Type-1 suffix conveys merely a circumstantial or incidental similarity, while the Type-2 suffix implies that the similarity is an integral aspect of the word. In English, such a distinction would most likely be conveyed by using a different word. For example, note the difference when we add these two suffixes to the Ithkuil word wal ‘person’: walurx means ‘identical-looking person,’ whereas waluirx means ‘twin.’ In this way, we can say that the suffix -Vrx with Type-1 vocalic infixes conveys a circumstantial application of its meaning to a stem, while with Type-2 vocalic infixes it conveys a derivational application of its meaning (i.e., wholly new concepts or words are derived from the stem).</p><p>As for Type-3 suffixes, these are used in circumstances where the meaning of the suffix is meant to be applied not to the formative itself, but rather to the immediately adjacent suffix. This is somewhat analogous to the way that adverbs can be used to modify descriptive adjectives in English. For example, in the phrase ‘ <em>suddenly blue sky’</em> , it is the blueness that is sudden, not the sky. In Ithkuil, Type-3 affixes modify another affix (usually the one following, unless there are only two suffixes on the stem, in which case the affix order is irrelevant); this is done by using Type-3 vocalic infixes. For example, the affix - Vcč/7 , which means ‘made-up, imaginary,’ can be used both circumstantially (using the Type-1 infix) and derivationally (using the Type-2 infix) to modify a stem, or can be used to modify only the adjacent suffix (using the Type-3 infix). Such suffixes must immediately precede the suffix they are modifying, unless they are in word-final position, in which case they modify the immediately preceding suffix. This is illustrated below:<br> Type-1 affix:* walocča: ‘a made-up/imaginary person’<br> Type-2 affix:* waloicča : ‘a fictional person’ (i.e., a character from a work of fiction)<br> Type-3 affix:* waluocčox : ‘a person who is imagined to be large’ (where suffix -V₁x/7 = ‘large’)</p><p>The following example illustrates the use of a Type-2 affix modified by a Type-3 affix to create the concept of ‘ <em>breakfast’</em> , analyzable literally as “formal/conventionalized instance of morning-time eating/drinking of foodstuff”:<br> Alksodëubzuöřcá kšilu.</p><p>‘eat/drink.foodstuff’-DYN-CSV-PRX-FEA₂/5-AMD³/6-OBS ‘clown’-OBJ-IND</p><p><em>‘The clown is eating breakfast.’</em><br> 7.3 Glottal Stop Requirements</p><p>There are two situations in which a glottal stop must be inserted into a formative in order to avoid confusion caused by the <code>VxCs</code> affixes in Slot V.

Therefore, it is necessary to signal early on whether Slot V of a formative will contain more than one <code>CsVx</code> - or - <code>VxCs</code> - affix.

Cases 37-68 utilize the same four vowel-form series (i.e., no glottal-stop is added to the <code>Vx</code> increment), the distinction from the first 36 cases being indicated by their different <code>Cs</code> increment. This structure allows case-accessor and case-stacking affixes to appear in Slot V or Slot VII or in affixual adjuncts.
