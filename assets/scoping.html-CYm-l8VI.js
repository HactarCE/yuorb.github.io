Should their Slot lack the capacity to convey the necessary morphological information, it is recommended to utilize alternative Formatives or to apply Affix(ual Adjunct)s to meet the requirements.</p><p>Register Adjuncts have the ability to govern any designated noun, single Formative, phrase, clause, or sentence, including Register clauses. Register Initial Adjunct and Register Final Adjunct encapsulate the governed content. A Register clause frequently imparts semantic insights to an adjoining verb or noun; however, it should not be assumed that these words hold scope over the Register clause. Given that a Register clause functions as a parenthetical and self-contained sentence, its removal does not disrupt the overall message conveyed by the original sentence. These clauses have the flexibility to be situated at any point within a sentence, and may even function as standalone sentences. A typical illustration of this is the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register, which, being the default Register, is frequently disregarded; thus, it is prudent to presume that any sentence, including sentences enclosed by Non-<abbr>NNR</abbr>, is <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked. It is advisable to consider every sentence as being governed by the Register, typically the <abbr>NNR</abbr>. As <abbr>NNR</abbr> is signified by the zero marker, a <abbr>NNR</abbr> clause is inherently autonomous, not subject to subordination by other Register clauses, yet capable of exerting influence over each one individually.</p><p>A Sentence-Initial Bias governs the entirety of the sentence, rather than the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register. Bias(es) can form a sentence, but should still be <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)rral.</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)“cat”-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A simple sentence</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)hi</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)SPF</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>...</dt><dd>...</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hiu.</dt><dd>SPF_END</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of single Register clause</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)lf</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)ACC</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>lst.</dt><dd>ANP</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of Biases</div></div>',4);function l(r,p){const e=n("Mermaid");return a(),i("div",null,[c,t(e,{id:"mermaid-10",code:"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"}),t(e,{id:"mermaid-11",code:"eJxtTrFOwzAU3P0VlljPCFiQitQFxFSpqB0jBtuxa1MnDrabUjbyqXwJTkiVIHqLdee7d8cYI8kmpxZ0m1T13X2Nb8ce12vSfxPt/FEaHhJdbQjNiAexC7wxtDHFiwk8qtdBp6UNSibra7pZ/Spzt74tnn2oeLKtykVjJoMX2z9c1eWF9N083U3uqXSc10MUef7kkX3DLCMYW8p/fYKya7bMOwd2VtuiVUH0A3OoMWQQpeMxUg4BiRIKGjsYWLxhD4cKNTwavCMgIuGAFkd84IRPGtPJPUw3npQeJKqtc4srfnMvS46Ygt+rMyU//uZ6tA=="})])}const m=s(o,[["render",l],["__file","scoping.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/en/docs/scoping.html","title":"Scoping in New Ithkuil","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Scoping in New Ithkuil","description":"Referentials and Suppletive Adjuncts serve the same syntactic function as Formatives (Although they can only convey CCN case-scope).
